0	Ebbers denies WorldCom fraud Former WorldCom chief Bernie Ebbers has denied claims that he knew accountants were doctoring the books at the firm.
0	Speaking in court, Mr Ebbers rejected allegations he pressured ex-chief financial officer Scott Sullivan to falsify company financial statements.
0	Mr Sullivan made accounting decisions, he told the federal court, saying his finance chief had a keen command of the numbers.
0	Mr Ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy.
0	During his second day of questioning in the New York trial Mr Ebbers played down his working relationship with Mr Sullivan and denied he frequently met him to discuss company business when questioned by the prosecution.
0	In a lot of weeks, we would speak... three or four times, Mr Ebbers said, adding that conversations about finances were rarely one-on-one and were usually discussed by a group of people instead.
0	Mr Ebbers relationship to Mr Sullivan is key to the case surrounding financial corruption that led to the collapse of the firm in 2002 following the discovery of an $11bn accounting fraud.
0	The prosecutions star witness is Mr Sullivan, one of six WorldCom executives indicted in the case, He has pleaded guilty to fraud and appeared as a prosecution witness as part of an agreement with prosecutors.
0	During his time on the witness stand Mr Sullivan repeatedly told jurors he met frequently with Mr Ebbers, told him about changes made to WorldComs accounts to hide costs and had warned him such practises were improper.
0	However during the case on Tuesday Mr Ebbers denied the allegations.I wasnt advised by Scott Sullivan of anything ever being wrong, he told the court.Hes never told me he made an entry that wasnt right.
0	If he had, we wouldnt be here today. Mr Ebbers could face a jail sentence of up to 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.
0	Shareholders lost about $180bn in WorldComs collapse, 20,000 workers lost their jobs and the company went bankrupt.
0	The company emerged from bankruptcy last year and is now known as MCI.
0	Australia rates at four year high Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the countrys economy.
0	The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year.
0	However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter.
0	The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.
0	The rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance.
0	However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.
0	The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations.
0	Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures.Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited, said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.
0	At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Banks 2-3% target range.
0	However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the countrys current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn.
0	The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low.The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesnt look to me like its slowing in any unreasonable way, said Treasurer Peter Costello.
0	Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy.That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1, said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004. US company admits Benin bribery A US defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the West African state of Benin.
0	The Titan corporation was accused of funnelling more than $2m into the 2001 re-election campaign of President Mathieu Kerekou.
0	At the time, Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin.
0	There is no suggestion that Mr Kerekou was himself aware of any wrongdoing.
0	Titan, a California-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US anti-bribery laws.
0	It agreed to pay $13m in criminal penalties, as well as $15.5m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
0	The SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in Benin claiming ties with President Kerekou.
0	Some of the money was used to pay for T-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election.
0	Shortly after the poll, which Mr Kerekou won, Benin officials agreed to quadruple Titans management fee.
0	Prosecuting attorney Carol Lam said: All US companies should take note that attempting to bribe foreign officials is criminal conduct and will be appropriately prosecuted. The company says it no longer tolerates such practices.
0	Under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it is a crime for American firms to bribe foreign officials.
0	US insurer Marsh cuts 2,500 jobs Up to 2,500 jobs are to go at US insurance broker Marsh & McLennan in a shake up following bigger-than-expected losses.
0	The insurer said the cuts were part of a cost-cutting drive, aimed at saving millions of dollars.
0	Marsh posted a $676m (£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (£195.3m) profit a year before.
0	It blamed an $850m payout to settle a price-rigging lawsuit, brought by New York attorney general Elliot Spitzer.
0	Under the settlement announced in January, Marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the October-to-December quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter.Clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in MMCs financial history, Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said.
0	An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the worlds biggest insurer said.
0	Analysts expect its latest round of cuts to focus on its brokerage unit, which employs 40,000 staff.
0	The latest layoffs will take the total number of jobs to go at the firm to 5,500 and are expected to lead to annual savings of more than $375m.
0	As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m.
0	Looking ahead, Mr Cherkasky forecast profitable growth for the year ahead with an operating margin in the upper-teens, and with the opportunity for further margin expansion.
0	Meanwhile, the company also announced it would spin-off its MMC Capital private equity unit, which manages the $3bn Trident Funds operation, to a group of employees.
0	Marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent.
0	The insurer hit the headlines in October last year when it faced accusations of price rigging.
0	New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer sued the company, accusing it of receiving illegal payments to steer clients to selected firms as well as rigging bids and fixing prices.
0	In January, Marsh agreed to pay $850m to settle the suit - a figure in line with the placement fees it collected in 2003 - and agreed to change its business practices.
0	In February, a former senior executive pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a wide-ranging probe of fraud and bid-rigging in the insurance industry.
0	In January, a former senior vice president also pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the investigation.
0	In an effort to reform its business practises, Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers.As a result, we are ready to put these matters behind us and move ahead in 2005 to restore the trust our clients have placed in us and to rebuild shareholder value, Mr Cherkasky said.
0	US seeks new $280bn smoker ruling The US Justice Department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.
0	Earlier this month, a three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim - filed in 1999 by the administration of Bill Clinton - in a 2-1 decision.
0	Government lawyers said they would ask the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to hear the case.
0	The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking.Its pretty clear that theyve suffered a severe setback, said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the appeal was what the government would be expected to ask for.
0	Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts.
0	Among the firms accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson.
0	Prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations.
0	The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public.
0	They also said that they have met many of the governments demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states.
0	A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.
0	Central to the governments case was a meeting in the Plaza Hotel, New York, on 15 December, 1953.
0	Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking.
0	Despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years.
0	Altrias Philip Morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the companys main lawyer William Ohlemeyer told the BBC last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest.
0	Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal.
0	Budget Aston takes on Porsche British car maker Aston Martin has gone head-to-head with Porsches 911 sports cars with the launch of its cheapest model yet.
0	With a price tag under £80,000, the V8 Vantage is tens of thousands of pounds cheaper than existing Aston models.
0	The Vantage is the most important car in the history of our company, said Astons chief executive Ulrich Bez.
0	Aston - whose cars were famously used by James Bond - will unveil the Vantage at the Geneva Motor Show on Thursday.
0	Mr Bez - himself a former executive at rival Porsche - said the new car was the companys most affordable car ever and makes the brand accessible.
0	This in turn would make Aston Martin globally visible, but still very, very exclusive, he added.
0	First shown as a concept car at the 2003 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the V8 Vantage will be available in the UK in late summer.
0	Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Astons DB9, which Mr Bez described as the previous most important car for our company.
0	There is currently an 18 months waiting list for the DB9, Mr Bez said.
0	The Vantage will be built at the new Aston factory in Gaydon, near Warwick, and should more than double Astons total output from about 2,000 presently.
0	Golden rule intact says ex-aide Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule with a margin to spare, according to his former chief economic adviser.
0	Formerly one of Mr Browns closest Treasury aides, Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March.
0	He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.
0	Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Partys chances of winning, he added.
0	Last July, Mr Balls won the right to step down from his Treasury position and run for parliament, defending the Labour stronghold of Normanton in West Yorkshire.
0	Mr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign, saying he was playing a different role to the one he played in the last two elections.
0	He rejected speculation that Mr Brown was considering becoming Foreign Secretary, saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development.
0	Gordon Browns decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a sensible thing to do, since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, Mr Balls told the BBC.
0	Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions.
0	Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising.
0	Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January.I dont believe it would be a big election issue in Britain or a problem for Labour, Mr Balls said.
0	Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day.
0	Liberian economy starts to grow The Liberian economy started to grow in 2004, but sustained and deep reform efforts are needed to ensure long term growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.
0	An IMF mission made the comments in a report published following 10 days of talks with the transition government.
0	The IMF said that, according to data provided by the Liberians, the countrys GDP rose by 2% in 2004, after a 31% decline in 2003.
0	Liberia is recovering from a 14-year civil war that came to an end in 2003.
0	The power-sharing National Transition Government of Liberia will remain in place until elections on 11 October, the first presidential and parliamentary ballots since the conflict ended.
0	The IMF said Liberias economy started to grow last year thanks to a continued strong recovery in rubber production, domestic manufacturing and local services including post-conflict reconstruction.
0	The IMF however remains cautious about what it sees as a lack of transparency in government actions.
0	In particular, it pointed to mystery surrounding the sale of iron ore stockpiles and the alleged disappearance of some import and export permits.
0	These matters are now being investigated by the Liberian authorities and the IMF has called for their findings to be made public.
0	The IMF also said it was crucial that the Central Bank of Liberia be strengthened, the national budget be effectively managed and a sound economic basis built to allow the countrys large external debt to be addressed.The IMF team stands ready to assist the (Liberian) authorities in strengthening the areas mentioned, said the report.The team agreed with the (Liberian) authorities that the period until elections and the inauguration of a new government will pose exceptional challenges to fiscal management, and expresses its willingness to provide... continued support. Slowdown hits US factory growth US industrial production increased for the 21st month in a row in February, but at a slower pace than in January, official figures show.
0	The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index fell to 55.3 in February, from an adjusted 56.4 in January.
0	Although the index was lower than in January, the fact that it held above 50 shows continued growth in the sector.February was another good month in the manufacturing sector, said ISM survey chairman Norbert Ore.
0	While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem.
0	Exports and imports remain strong, he said.
0	Analysts had expected Februarys figure to be stronger than Januarys and come in at 57.
0	Of the 20 manufacturing sectors surveyed by ISM, 13 reported growth.
0	They included the textiles, apparel, tobacco, chemicals and transportation sectors.
0	The ISMs index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from the responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies.
0	Lufthansa flies back to profit German airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.
0	In a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; £274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003.
0	Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003.
0	Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus.
0	It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business.
0	Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
0	The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share.
0	In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend.
0	The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.
0	Japanese growth grinds to a halt Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.
0	Output in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%.
0	Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short.
0	The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.
0	The economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums.
0	One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.
0	The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery.
0	But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive.
0	The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year.
0	The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around.Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker, said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo.Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics.The amber light is flashing. The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japans massive public debt.
0	Unilever shake up as profit slips Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever is to merge its two management boards after reporting unsatisfactory earnings for 2004.
0	It blamed the poor results on sluggish decision making, a rise in discounted retailers and a wet European summer.
0	The company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its Slimfast range.
0	Unilever, which owns brands including Dove soap, said annual pre-tax profit fell 36% to 2.9bn euros (£1.99bn).
0	Shares fell 1% to 510.75 pence in London, and dropped by 1.2% to 50.50 euros in Amsterdam.
0	Under the restructuring plans, Patrick Cescau, the UK-based co-chairman, will become group chief executive.
0	Dutch co-chairman Antony Burgmans will take on the role of non-executive chairman.
0	We have recognised the need for greater clarity of leadership and we are moving to a simpler leadership structure that will provide a sharper operational focus, Mr Burgmans said.We are leaving behind one of the key features of Unilevers governance but this is a natural development following the changes introduced last year. The company, which has had dual headquarters in Rotterdam and London since 1930, will announce the location of its head office at a later date.
0	Unilever is not alone in trying to simplify its business.
0	Oil giant Shell last year dismantled its dual-ownership structure, after a series of problems relating to the size of its oil reserves that hammered its share price and led to the resignation of key board members.The best part of the news this morning was that the company announced a structure simplification, said Arjan Sweere, an analyst at Petercam.
0	The company said the organizational changes would speed decision making, and it also may make further changes.
0	The company said its main focus will be on improving profits, and it is planning to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands.While it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected, we have also lost some market share, said Mr Cescau.We let a range of targets limit our ability flexibility and did not adjust our plans quickly enough to a more difficult business environment. Our objective is to reverse the share loss that we experienced in some markets in 2004 and return to growth. Unilever said European sales fell 2.8% last year, dragged down by below part sales at its beverage division, where revenues dipped by almost 4%.
0	Sales of ice cream and frozen food dipped by 3.4% In the US last year, revenue grew by 1.5% despite disappointing sales in Slimfast, the company said.
0	In Asia, leading products came under attack from rivals such as Procter & Gamble.
0	Unilever took a 1.5bn euro one-time charge in the fourth quarter, including a 650m euro write-down on Slimfast diet foods.
0	Sales of Slimfast products have been hit in recent years by the popularity of the Atkins diet.
0	But looking ahead, Unilever said it was optimistic about prospects for its slimming products saying that demand is on the wane for rival low-carbohydrate diets.
0	The company also said it planned to spend 500m euros this year buying back shares.
0	France Telecom gets Orange boost Strong growth in subscriptions to mobile phone network Orange has helped boost profits at owner France Telecom.
0	Orange added more than five million new customers in 2004, leading to a 10% increase in its revenues.
0	Increased take-up of broadband telecoms services also boosted France Telecoms profits, which showed a 5.5% rise to 18.3bn euros ($23.4bn; £12.5bn).
0	France Telecom is to spend 578m euros on buying out minority shareholders in data services provider Equant.
0	France Telecom, one of the worlds largest telecoms and internet service providers, saw its full-year sales rise 2.2% to 47.2bn euros in 2004.
0	Orange enjoyed strong growth outside France and the United Kingdom - its core markets - swelling its subscriber base to 5.4 million.
0	France Telecoms broadband customers also increased, rising to 5.1 million across Europe by the end of the year.
0	The firm said it had met its main strategic objectives of growing its individual businesses and further reducing its large debt.
0	An ill-fated expansion drive in the late 1990s saw France Telecoms debt soar to 72bn euros by 2002.
0	However, this has now been reduced to 43.9bn euros.Our results for 2004 allow us to improve our financial structure while focusing on the innovation that drives our strategy, said chief executive Thierry Breton.
0	Looking ahead, the company forecast like-for-like sales growth of between 3% and 5% over the next three years.
0	France Telecom is consolidating its interest in Equant, which provides telecoms and data services to businesses.
0	Subject to approval by shareholders of the two firms, it will buy the shares in Equant it does not already own.
0	France Telecom said it would fund the deal by selling an 8% stake in telephone directory company PagesJaunes.
0	Brussels raps mobile call charges The European Commission has written to the mobile phone operators Vodafone and T-Mobile to challenge the high rates they charge for international roaming.
0	In letters sent to the two companies, the Commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the German mobile phone market.
0	It is the second time Vodafone has come under the Commissions scrutiny.
0	The UK operator is already appealing against allegations that its UK roaming rates are unfair and excessive.
0	Vodafones response to the Commissions letter was defiant.We believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges, said a Vodafone spokesman.However we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond. The Commissions investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekoms T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany.
0	The Commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers.The Commission aims to ensure that European consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the European Union, the Commission said in a statement.
0	Vodafone and O2, Britains other big mobile phone operator, were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year.
0	Vodafone sent the Commission a response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for a reply.
0	The Vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in Germany.
0	The companies will have three months to respond to the Commissions allegations and the process may go on for some time yet, the spokesman said.
0	The Commission could charge the companies up to 10% of their annual turnover, though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded.
0	The Commissions latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across Europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad.
0	The investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market.
0	WorldCom director admits lying The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has admitted before a New York court that he used to lie to fellow board members.
0	Speaking at the trial of his former boss Bernard Ebbers, Scott Sullivan said he lied to the board to cover up the hole in WorldComs finances.
0	Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldComs collapse in 2002.
0	He pleads not guilty.
0	The firm had been overstating its accounts by $11bn (£8.5bn).
0	Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness.
0	Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldComs finances.
0	In the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers lawyer Reid Weingarten asked Mr Sullivan: If you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isnt that right? On that date, yes.
0	I was lying, replied Mr Sullivan.
0	Mr Weingarten has suggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something Mr Sullivan denies.
0	Mr Sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert Roberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom.
0	The trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week.
0	Under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations.
0	Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to stop the fraud.
0	Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.
0	WorldComs problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies.
0	Prosecutors allege that the companys top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period.
0	WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.
0	Glaxo aims high after profit fall GlaxoSmithKline saw its profits fall 9% last year to £6.2bn ($11.5bn), but Europes biggest drugmaker says a recovery during 2005 is on the way.
0	Cheap copies of its drugs, particularly anti-depressants Paxil and Wellbutrin, and a weak dollar had hit profits, but global sales were up 1% in 2004.
0	The firm is confident its new drug pipeline will deliver profits despite the failure of an obesity drug.
0	Chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier said it had been a difficult year.
0	In early afternoon trade in London the company share price was down 1% at 1218 pence.
0	Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over £1.5bn of lost sales to generics but still managing to grow the business.The continuing success of our key products means we can now look forward to a good performance in 2005, he said.2005 will also be an important year in terms of research and development pipeline progress. However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as 771, after disappointing clinical trial results.
0	Glaxo is relying on new treatments for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, depression, HIV/AIDS and allergies to lift the pace of sales growth after several disappointing years.
0	Japan bank shares up on link talk Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (SMFG), and Daiwa Securities jumped amid speculation that two of Japans biggest financial companies will merge.
0	Financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun claimed that the firms will join up next year and already have held discussions with Japanese regulators.
0	The firms denied that they are about to link up, but said they are examining ways of working more closely together.
0	SMFG shares climbed by 2.7% to 717,000, and Daiwa added 5.3% to 740 yen.
0	Combining SMFG, Japans third-biggest lender, and Daiwa, the countrys second-largest brokerage firm, would create a company with assets of more than $1,000bn (£537bn).
0	SMFG President Yoshifumi Nishikawa said that the companies needed to bolster their businesses.Both companies need to strengthen retail and other operations, he said, adding that its an issue we have in common.
0	Daiwa said that although it is true that the two groups have been engaging in various discussions to enhance cooperation, there are no plans to enter into negotiations to consolidate the two businesses.
0	Analysts said that consolidation in Japans financial sector was likely to continue and that it was likely to have a positive impact on earnings.Cross-selling opportunities between banks and brokers are increasing thanks to deregulation, so we can expect the relationship to get even stronger, said Heronry Nozaki, an analyst at NikkoCitigroup.
0	The merger would be a good move, he added.
0	Car giant hit by Mercedes slump A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.
0	The German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003.
0	Mercedes-Benzs woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations.
0	Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.
0	Mercedes profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros.
0	For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros.
0	Sales of Mercedes brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.
0	The carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range.
0	Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year.
0	The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes position as the worlds most successful luxury brand.
0	However, DaimlerChryslers shares fell 1.5% on the news.While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz, Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.
0	In contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%.
0	The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.
0	Overall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros.
0	Chryslers strong performance helped the worlds fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.
0	The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment, said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChryslers chairman.
0	DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso.
0	DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso.
0	Looking forward, DaimerChryslers profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005.
0	However, it is expecting significant improvements in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.
0	Ericsson sees earnings improve Telecoms equipment supplier Ericsson has posted a rise in fourth quarter profits thanks to clients like Deutsche Telekom upgrade their networks.
0	Operating profit in the three months to 31 December was 9.5bn kronor (£722m; $1.3bn) against 6.3bn kronor last year.
0	Shares tumbled, however, as the company reported a profit margin of 45.6%, less than the 47.3% forecast by analysts and down from 47.1% in the third quarter.
0	Ericsson shares dropped 5.9% to 20.7 kronor in early trading on Thursday.
0	However, the company remained optimistic about its earnings outlook after sales in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 39.4bn kronor.Long-term growth drivers of the industry remain solid, Ericsson said in a statement.
0	Chief executive Carl-Henric Svanberg explained that about 27% of the worlds population now has access to mobile communications.This is exciting for a company with a vision of an all-communicating world, he added.
0	Mr Svanberg, however, warned that the extra demand that had driven 2004 sales had already dissipated and it was business as usual.
0	He added that sales in the first three months of 2005 would be subject to normal seasonality.
0	For the whole of 2004, Ericsson returned a net profit of 19bn kronor, compared with a loss of 10.8bn kronor in 2003.
0	Sales climbed to 131.9 billion kronor from 117.7bn kronor in 2003.
0	Bank opts to leave rates on hold The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.
0	The Banks Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy.
0	But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year.
0	Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears.
0	Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one months economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge.
0	Economists see next weeks inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.
0	Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months.
0	Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months.
0	Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.
0	And recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years.
0	Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike.The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months,  he said.Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends. Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside.
0	Business groups welcomed the MPCs widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises.
0	The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was concerned by the clamour in some quarters for early interest rate increases.We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted, said David Frost, BCC director general.Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures. Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an interesting challenge.Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling, he said.However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher. Nigeria to boost cocoa production The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.
0	Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008.
0	The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings.
0	Nigeria is currently the worlds fourth-largest cocoa producer.
0	Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s.
0	But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970.
0	At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption.
0	He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries.
0	The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year.
0	However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals.People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy, said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters.The farmers in the village never see any assistance, he added.
0	At the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the worlds second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records.
0	The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04.
0	Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the worlds leading cocoa grower.
0	US interest rates increased to 2% US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move.
0	The Federal Reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam.
0	US companies created twice as many jobs as expected in October while exports hit record levels in September.
0	Analysts said a clear-cut victory for President Bush in last weeks election paved the way for a rise.
0	Another rise could be in store for December, some economists warned.
0	The Feds Open Market Committee - which sets interest rate policy in the US - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise.
0	The Fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in June, August and September.
0	The Central Bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth.
0	The Fed did not rule out raising rates once again in December but noted that any future increases would take place at a measured pace.
0	In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained well contained while the US economy appeared to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices.
0	Financial analysts broadly welcomed the Feds move and shares traded largely flat.
0	The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48.
0	Recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the US economy.
0	US firms created 337,000 jobs last month, twice the amount expected, while exports reached record levels in September.
0	The economy grew 3.7% in the third quarter, slower than forecast, but an improvement on the 3.3% growth seen in the second quarter.
0	Analysts claimed the Feds assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in December.
0	Lets wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarters energy price drag before concluding that the Fed has more work to do in 2005, said Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets.
0	I think the Federal Reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate, said Sung Won Sohn, chief US economist for Wells Fargo Bank.The economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics, employment and the price of oil, he added.
0	The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy.
0	The Bank of England (BoE) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked.
0	In a report published on Wednesday, the Bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years.
0	However, BoE governor Mervyn King warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end.
0	US bank in $515m SEC settlement Five Bank of America subsidiaries have agreed to pay a total of $515m (£277m) to settle an investigation into fraudulent trading share practices.
0	The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlements, the latest in an industry-wide clean-up of US mutual funds.
0	The SEC also said it had brought fraud charges against two ex-senior executives of Columbia Distributor.
0	Columbia Distributor was part of FleetBoston, bought by BOA last year.
0	Three other ex-Columbia executives agreed settlements with the SEC.
0	The SEC has set itself the task of stamping out the mutual funds use of market-timing, a form of quick-fire, short-term share trading that harms the interests of small investors, with whom mutual funds are particularly popular.
0	In the last two years, it has imposed penalties totalling nearly $2bn on 15 funds.
0	The SEC unveiled two separate settlements, one covering BOAs direct subsidiaries, and another for businesses that were part of FleetBoston at the time.
0	In both cases, it said there had been secret deals to engage in market timing in mutual fund shares.
0	The SEC agreed a deal totalling $375m with Banc of America Capital Management, BACAP Distributors and Banc of America Securities.
0	It was made up of $250m to pay back gains from market timing, and $125m in penalties.
0	It is to be paid to the damaged funds and their shareholders.
0	Separately, the SEC said it had reached a $140m deal - equally split between penalties and compensation - in its probe into Columbia Management Advisors (CAM) and Columbia Funds Distributor (CFD) and three ex-Columbia executives.
0	These businesses became part of BOA when it snapped up rival bank FleetBoston in a $47bn merger last March.
0	The SEC filed civil fraud charges in a Boston Federal court against James Tambone, who it says headed CFDs sales operations, and his alleged second in command Robert Hussey.
0	The SEC is pressing for the highest tier of financial penalties against the pair for multiple violations, repayment of any personal gains, and an injunction to prevent future breaches, a spokeswoman for the SECs Boston office told the BBC.
0	There was no immediate comment from the mens lawyers.
0	The SECs settlement with CAM and CFD included agreements with three other ex-managers, Peter Martin, Erik Gustafson and Joseph Palombo, who paid personal financial penalties of between $50-100,000.
0	Train strike grips Buenos Aires A strike on the Buenos Aires underground has caused traffic chaos and large queues at bus stops in the Argentine capital.
0	Tube workers walked out last week demanding a 53% pay rise and in protest against the installation of automatic ticket machines.
0	Metrovias, the private firm which runs the five tube lines in the city, has offered an 8% increase in wages.
0	The firm promised no jobs would be lost as a result of new ticket machines.
0	It said it would put this commitment on paper.
0	Underground staff have warned they will continue with the protests until the management put an acceptable offer on the table.
0	The Argentine Work Ministry has been mediating in the conflict and it could call an obligatory conciliation, which would force both sides to find a solution and put an end to the conflict.
0	Some tube commuters have not hidden their frustration at the ongoing strike and have broken the windows of the underground trains, according to the local press.We are taken as hostages.
0	I dont know who is right, but the harm ones are us, said accountant Jose Lopez.
0	Bargain calls widen Softbank loss Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.
0	The service, launched in December and dubbed Otoku or bargain, has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said.
0	The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m).
0	But without the Otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006.
0	The firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year.
0	It was born in the 1990s tech boom, investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star, till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard.
0	Its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of Japan Telecom, the countrys third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm.
0	The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December.
0	WMC profits up amid bid criticism Australian mining firm WMC Resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.
0	WMC said it made net profits of 1.33bn Australian dollars ($1bn; £550m) in 2004, up from A$246bn the year before.
0	It is currently arguing against an offer from Swiss Xstrata, which the firm raised to A$8.4bn last week after WMC said it was an undervaluation.
0	Now reports say that the Australian government is against the deal.
0	Trade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be against the national interest.
0	Mr Vaile, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review, compared Xstratas attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australias Woodside Petroleum in 2001.
0	The bid was thrown out by Treasurer Peter Costello on national interest grounds.
0	WMCs interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said.
0	WMC itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right.
0	Its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals.
0	Copper and nickel in particular have been in high demand thanks to Chinas booming economy, which expanded more than 9% in each of the past two years.
0	Nickel prices rose 43% during the year, with copper up 36%.
0	Barclays profits hit record level Barclays, the UKs third-biggest bank, has seen annual pre-tax profits climb to record levels boosted by a sharp rise in business at its investment arm.
0	Profits for the year to 31 December rose 20% to £4.6bn ($8.6bn).
0	Barclays chief John Varley said the bank had caught the winds of a very strong world economy.
0	Earnings at Barclays Capital investment bank rose 25% to £1.04bn, but investment in branch operations held back growth in its UK retail business.
0	The group is the first of Britains five big banks to report 2004 results.
0	According to analysts forecasts, HSBC, the biggest UK bank by stock market valuation, will report profits of £9.4bn later this month.
0	Barclays results were in line with market expectations.
0	Its Global Investors wing made £347m, an 82% jump on 2003 figures.
0	Profits at Barclaycard rose by 5% to £801m but were said to have been affected by a series of interest rate rises and investment to grow its customer base.
0	The bank also blamed margins pressure on its mortgage business and spending on its branches over the past year for a 1% fall in profits in its UK retail division to £1.13bn.
0	The outlook for 2005 is good as a result of balance sheet growth and investments made in 2004, Mr Varley said.
0	Barclays cautioned that growth this year may be slower than in 2004 on the back of softer US and Chinese economies and the impact of interest rate rises on household spending in the UK.
0	It added its bid to acquire a controlling stake in South Africas leading retail bank Absa, was being considered by regulatory authorities.
0	Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Varley declined to be drawn on reports that Barclays had held merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo.
0	A tie-up between Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo would create the worlds fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn.
0	At 1405 GMT, shares in Barclays were trading down 0.67% at 590 pence.The headline numbers are in line, but the story is costs, said analyst Alex Potter at Lehman Brothers.They are a bit more aggressive than we had expected.
0	The cost overshoot is not in Barclays Capital but in the UK bank. Yukos owner sues Russia for $28bn The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).
0	The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill.
0	Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal.
0	Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.
0	The Russian governments argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the units full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards.
0	It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.
0	But critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control.
0	According to Menatep, the governments actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments.We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation, said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep.The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today. Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to virtually nothing since 2003 as a result of the Russian governments action, as its shares have fallen 97%.
0	According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then.
0	Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said.
0	While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case.
0	But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification.Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors, he said.
0	Yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection.
0	It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft.
0	Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
0	Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep.
0	He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.
0	Qantas sees profits fly to record Australian airline Qantas has posted a record fiscal first-half profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.
0	Net profit in the six months ending 31 December rose 28% to A$458.4m ($357.6m; £191m) from a year earlier.
0	Analysts expected a figure closer to A$431m.
0	Qantas shares fell almost 3%, however, after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half.
0	Sales will dip by at least A$30m after the Indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations, Qantas said.
0	The tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about, chief executive Geoff Dixon explained.It certainly affected Japanese travel into Australia.
0	As soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for Australia. Higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months.We dont have as much hedging benefit in the second half as we had in the first, said chief financial officer Peter Gregg.
0	Qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier Virgin Blue and the Australian government is in talks about whether to allow Singapore Airlines to fly between the Australia and the US - one of Qantas key routes.
0	Even so, the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous 12 months.
0	Analysts have forecast full-year profit will rise about 11% to around A$720 million ($563 million).
0	Qantas boss Mr Dixon also said he would be reviewing the groups cost-cutting measures.
0	During the first six months of the fiscal year, Qantas made savings of A$245m, and is on track to top its target of A$500m for the full year.
0	Last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out Australia, with Mr Dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain all-Australian.
0	Iraq to invite phone licence bids Iraq is to invite bids for two telephone licences, saying it wants to significantly boost nationwide coverage over the next decade.
0	Bids have been invited from local, Arab and foreign companies, Iraqs Ministry of Communications said.
0	The winner will work in partnership with the Iraqi Telecommunications and Post Company (ITPC).
0	The firms will install and operate a fixed phone network, providing voice, fax and internet services.
0	The ministry said that it wanted to increase Iraqs very low telephone service penetration rate from about 4.5% today to about 25% within 10 years. It also hopes to develop a highly visible and changeable telecommunication sector.
0	Details of the bidding and tender process will be published on the ministrys website on 9 February.
0	It also is planning a road-show for investors in Amman, Jordan.
0	The ministry said it would base its selection on criteria including the speed of implementation, tariff rates, coverage, and the firms experience and financial strength.
0	Aviation firms eye booming India Indias defence minister has opened the countrys Aero India 2005 air show with an invitation for global aerospace firms to outsource jobs to the nation.
0	Pranab Mukherjee said such companies could take advantage of Indias highly skilled workers and low wages.
0	More than 240 civil and military aerospace firms from 31 countries are attending the show.
0	Analysts said India could spend up to $35bn (£18.8bn) in the aviation market over the next 20 years.
0	Giants such Boeing and Airbus - on the civil aviation front - as well as Lockheed Martin and Frances Snecma - on the military side - are some of the firms attending the show.There is tremendous scope for outsourcing from India in areas where the companies are competitive, said Mr Mukerjee.We are keen to welcome international collaborations that are in conformity with our national goals. Lockheed said it had signed an agreement with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to share information on the P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft.
0	In fact, the Indian Armed Force is considering the buying of used P-3 Orion as well as F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed.
0	The US military industry has show a strong interest to open a link with India, now that relations between the two countries have improved a lot.
0	In fact, it is the first time the US Air Force will attend the air show since sanctions imposed in 1998 after Indias nuclear tests were lifted.
0	But the Indian Air Force is also considering proposals from other foreign firms such as Frances Dassault Aviation, Swedens Saab and Russias Mikoyan-Gurevich.
0	Meanwhile, Frances Snecma has also said it plans a joint venture with HAL to make engine parts, with an initial investment of $6.5m.
0	On the civilian front, Boeing announced a deal with Indias HCL Technologies to develop a platform for the flight test system of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.
0	The US company also said it had agreed with a new Indian budget airline the sale of 10 737-800 planes for $630m.
0	The airline, SpiceJet, will also have the option to acquire 10 more aircraft.
0	Airbus has also recently signed fresh deals with two Indian airlines - Air Deccan and Kingfisher.
0	In addition, the European company has plans to open a training centre in India.
0	Meanwhile, flag carrier Air India is considering to buy 50 new aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus.No other market is going to see the growth that will be seen here in the coming years, said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president Boeing.
0	Russian oil merger excludes Yukos The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include Yugansk, which was controversially bought last year.
0	The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares.
0	Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off.
0	Under the agreement, the state will get a controlling share of Gazprom in exchange for Rosneft.
0	The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade.
0	Speaking on NTV television, which is controlled by Gazprom, Mr Miller added that Yugansk, which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov.
0	According to reports from Russian News Agency Interfax, the deal should go through in the next two to three months.
0	Obtaining majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares, Mr Miller added.
0	By opening up trading in Gazprom to foreigners, the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders.
0	Currently, foreigners can only trade in Gazprom via a small issue of London-listed proxy shares.This is positive news for the international investment community, Global Asset Management investment chief David Smith said.The majority of investors are going to be happy, he added.
0	However, analysts were disappointed that Yugansk would not be included in the deal.Yugansk is a heavy cashflow generator and would have been a much better asset for Gazprom, Renaissance Capital energy analyst Adam Landes told Reuters news agency.
0	But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom.Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk, he added.
0	Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russias total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk.
0	However, the merged group will still remain outside Russias top five oil producers - led by Lukoil with 11% of the market , followed by TNK-BP which is half owned by BP, and Surgutneftegaz.
0	Instead, the merged Gazprom-Rosneft group will rank alongside Sibneft with 7% of the market.
0	Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in December, following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on Yukos.
0	The shell company was then snapped up by Rosneft.
0	Yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the US courts.
0	The unit was auctioned by Russian authorities to help pay off a $27.5bn back-tax bill.
0	Brazil buy boosts Belgiums Inbev Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazils biggest beer firm Ambev last year.
0	Inbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005.
0	The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros.
0	The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the worlds biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004.
0	The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase.
0	US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales.
0	Continuing demand for Inbevs products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover.Its the Brazil business thats doing it, said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbevs strong performance.
0	Ambev boosted its share of Brazils beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported.
0	In contrast, Inbevs European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%.
0	Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.
0	Salary scandal in Cameroon Cameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it 1bn CFA francs ($2m; £1m) a month.
0	About 500 officials are accused of either awarding themselves extra money or claiming salaries for non-existent workers.
0	Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni, who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year, said those found guilty would face tough punishments.
0	The scam is believed to have begun in 1994.
0	The prime ministers office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry.
0	In certain cases, staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings.
0	The prime ministers office said auditors had found irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants.
0	It added that the staff in question appear to have received unearned salaries, boosting the payroll.
0	Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed.The prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty, he told the BBCs Network Africa programme.
0	Mr Inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in December after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the countrys public finances.
0	In one initiative designed to improve efficiency, civil servants who arrived late for work were locked out of their offices.
0	The government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries.
0	In a report compiled by anti-corruption body Transparency International in 2003, graft was said to be pervasive in Cameroon.
0	US adds more jobs than expected The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.
0	In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains.
0	Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing.
0	While the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, this was because more people were now actively seeking work.
0	The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast.
0	In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000.
0	The better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading.It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year, said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons.
0	Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week.It should empower the Fed to clearly do something, said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston.
0	Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September.
0	The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the USs record trade deficit.
0	There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.
0	Feta cheese battle reaches court A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.
0	The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name.
0	The Commissions decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne.
0	But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.
0	The Commissions controversial 2002 ruling gave protected designation of origin status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.
0	From 2007 onwards, Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products.
0	The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese, Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC.
0	Denmark is Europes second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece.
0	It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie.It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation, Mr Kristiansen said.That is just one of the costs. The case will also have a major impact on Britains sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses.
0	Judy Bell, the companys founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product.If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation, she said.We have never tried to pull the wool over anyones eyes - its very clear from the label that its Yorkshire feta. The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years.
0	Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goats milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine.
0	Greece makes 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption.
0	The Court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.
0	Ukraine revisits state sell-offs Ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration.
0	The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a limited list of companies is being drawn up.
0	But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms.
0	The government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices.
0	More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled.
0	Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed.We will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands. A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted.
0	The list will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion, he said.
0	An open-ended list could further damage outside investors fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit.
0	But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said.
0	As a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands.Theyre aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divides within Ukraine, he said.They dont want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set. Foreign investment in Ukraine, at about $40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-Soviet states.
0	Mr Yushchenko became president after two elections in December, the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests.
0	His opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, still has huge support in the countrys eastern industrial heartland.
0	Mr Yushchenkos administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma, of corruption.
0	The privatisation reviews number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchmas son-in-law, for $800m (£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups.
0	The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the worlds most profitable.We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state, Mr Yushchenko told an investors conference in Kiev.
0	One of the jilted bidders, Netherlands-based group LNM, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.
0	If the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest, a spokesman told BBC News.
0	A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Units Mr Hensel.
0	But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale.That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules, he told BBC News.
0	Bank set to leave rates on hold UK interest rates are set to remain on hold at 4.75% following the latest meeting of the Bank of England.
0	The Banks rate-setting committee has put up rates five times in the past year but rates have been on hold since September amid signs of a slowdown.
0	Economic growth slowed in the previous quarter, as manufacturing output fell, while consumer confidence has slipped.
0	There is also growing evidence that the previously booming UK housing market is now cooling.
0	House prices fell 0.4% in October, according to the Nationwide, their biggest monthly fall since February 2001.
0	Last month, Bank of England governor Mervyn King said that the economy had hit a softer patch after rapid economic growth in the first half of 2004.
0	Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said it was very unlikely that the Bank of England would put rates up again this time around.There have been sufficient signs in the economy of a slowdown to stay the Bank of Englands hand, he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme.
0	However, Mr Jeffrey said he believed the slowdown in economic activity was temporary and it was dangerous to assume that rates had peaked.I still think interest rates are going up, he said.We are not out of the woods. Winter freeze keeps oil above $50 Oil prices carried on rising on Wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs.
0	Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since November.
0	Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price.
0	US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday.
0	A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in New York on Tuesday.
0	Opec members said on Tuesday that, given such high prices, the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.
0	Although below last years peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004s average of $41.48.
0	Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.
0	Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days.
0	The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.The primary factor is the weak dollar, said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz.
0	Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.
0	Several Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia.I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this, Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libyas oil minister, told Reuters.I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel, he added.
0	German jobless rate at new record More than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show.
0	The figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age population, is the highest jobless rate in Europes biggest economy since the 1930s.
0	The news comes as the head of Germanys panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate.
0	Speaking on German TV, Bert Ruerup said the panels earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.
0	The German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms.
0	At their centre is the Hartz-IV programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised.
0	The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government.
0	Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeders Social Democrat-Green Party administration.
0	Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.
0	Still, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak.
0	The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January.
0	Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month.
0	Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January.
0	And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million.
0	The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.
0	Ore costs hit global steel firms Shares in steel firms have dropped worldwide amid concerns that higher iron ore costs will hit profit growth.
0	Shares in Germanys ThyssenKrupp, the UKs Corus and Frances Arcleor fell while Japans Nippon Steel slid after it agreed to pay 72% more for iron ore.
0	Chinas Baoshan Iron and Steel Co.
0	said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs.
0	The threat of higher raw material costs also hit industries such as carmakers.
0	Frances Peugeot warned that its profits may decline this year as a result of the higher steel, plastic and commodity prices.
0	Steelmakers have been enjoying record profits as demand for steel has risen, driven by the booming economies of countries such as China and India.
0	Steel prices rose by 8% globally in January alone and by 24% in China.
0	The boom times are far from over, but analysts say that earnings growth may slow.
0	The share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the worlds biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices.
0	Miners Rio Tinto and Cia.
0	Vale Do Rio Dolce (CVRD) this week managed to boost by 72% the price of their iron ore, a key component of steel.
0	Analysts had expected Japans Nippon to agree to a price rise of between 40% and 50%.
0	Steel analyst Peter Fish, director of Sheffield-based consulting group MEPS, said the extent of CVRDs price rise was uncharted territory, adding that the steel industry hasnt seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years.
0	Analysts now expect other iron ore producers, such as Australias BHP Billiton, to seek annual price rises of up to 70%.
0	The news triggered the share price weakness.It sparked worries that steel makers might not be able to increase product prices further [ to cover rising ore costs] explained Kazuhiro Takahashi of Daiwa Securities SMBC.
0	In Europe, Arcelor shed 2.1% to 17.58 euros in Paris, with ThyssenKrupp dropping 1.7% to 16.87 euros.
0	In London, Corus fell 2.2% to 55.57 pence.
0	Japans biggest steel company Nippon Steel lost 2.5% to 270 yen, with closest rival JFE Holdings down 3.4%.
0	Chinas Baoshan, the countrys largest steel producer, said that the uncertainty surrounding the industry has prompted it to pull its planned share sale.
0	The firm had been expected to offer 22.5bn yuan ($2.7bn) worth of shares to investors.
0	No date has been given for when the 5 billion shares will come to the market.
0	Baoshan stock climbed on news of the delay and its decision to increase the price of its steel by 10%.
0	BMW reveals new models pipeline BMW is preparing to enter the market for car-style people carriers, the firms chief has told BBC News.
0	Speaking at a BMW event ahead of the Geneva motor show, Helmut Panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in Europe.
0	In contrast, he said, the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade.Customers are moving out of the mini-van (and) traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore, he said.We have decided that BMW will enter the [crossover] segment, he said in the clearest indication yet about the car makers intentions.
0	Mr Panke praised the Honda Accura as the best execution yet of a crossover vehicle.We have decided that the BMW brand will enter the segment, he said.
0	A decision on just how BMW will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of 2005.
0	Typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets, Mr Panke said, implying that a BMW crossover could be on the market by 2008.
0	The coming switch is driven in part by the need for successful carmakers to stay aware of trans-Atlantic differences in the car market, Mr Panke insisted.
0	While in the US drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (SUVs), such as the BMW X5 and its sibling X3, in Europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable, Mr Panke said.Theres a growing market here, he said.We are going to go that way. Asian banks halt dollars slide The dollar regained some lost ground against most major currencies on Wednesday after South Korea and Japan denied they were planning a sell-off.
0	The dollar suffered its biggest one-day fall in four months on Tuesday on fears that Asian central banks were about to lower their reserves of dollars.
0	Japan is the biggest holder of dollar reserves in the world, with South Korea the fourth largest.
0	The dollar was buying 104.76 yen at 0950 GMT, 0.5% stronger on the day.
0	It also edged higher against both the euro and the pound, with one euro worth $1.3218, and one pound buying $1.9094.
0	Concerns over rising oil prices and the outlook for the dollar pushed down US stock markets on Tuesday; the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.6%, while the Nasdaq lost 1.3%.
0	The dollars latest slide began after a South Korean parliamentary report suggested the country, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, had plans to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar.
0	On Wednesday, however, South Korea moved to steady the financial markets.
0	It issued a statement that The Bank of Korea will not change the portfolio of currencies in its reserves due to short term market factors.
0	Japan, too, steadied nerves.
0	A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official told Reuters we have no plans to change the composition of currency holdings in the foreign reserves, and we are not thinking about expanding our euro holdings.
0	Japan has $850bn in foreign exchange reserves.
0	At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery.
0	Analysts, however, pointed to the dollars inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the USs economic problems had not disappeared.
0	The focus has been on the countrys massive trade and budget deficits, and analysts have predicted more dollar weakness to come.
0	Weak dollar trims Cadbury profits The worlds biggest confectionery firm, Cadbury Schweppes, has reported a modest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its results.
0	Underlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to £933m ($1.78bn) in 2004, but would have been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out.
0	The owner of brands such as Dairy Milk, Dr Pepper and Snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the UK.
0	Cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005.While the external commercial environment remains competitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005, said chief executive Todd Stitzer.
0	The modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in Europe.
0	Cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004.
0	Growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls - which enjoyed a successful year, with like-for-like sales up 6%.
0	Drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in US carbonated soft drinks, led by Dr Pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in Europe.
0	Cadbury added that its Fuel for Growth cost-cutting programme had saved £75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to £100m since the scheme began in mid-2003.
0	The programme is set to close 20% of the groups factories and shed 10% of the workforce.
0	Cadbury Schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK.
0	Oil prices fall back from highs Oil prices retreated from four-month highs in early trading on Tuesday after producers cartel Opec said it was now unlikely to cut production.
0	Following the comments by acting Opec secretary general Adnan Shihab-Eldin, US light crude fell 32 cents to $51.43 a barrel.
0	He said that high oil prices meant Opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in the second quarter.
0	In London, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $49.74 a barrel.
0	Opec members are next meeting to discuss production levels on 16 March.
0	On Monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-month high as cold weather in the US threatened stocks of heating oil.
0	US demand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this week, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year ago.
0	Cold weather across Europe has also put upward pressure on crude prices.
0	Winn-Dixie files for bankruptcy US supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart.
0	Winn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure.
0	It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites.
0	The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (£980m).
0	In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m.
0	Analysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading.
0	A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixies slide into bankruptcy was widely expected.
0	The companys new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around.This includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores, he said.
0	Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, said Mr Lynchs job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers.The real big issue is whats going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers, he said.
0	Why few targets are better than many The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the worlds leading economy by 2010.
0	But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige.
0	For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesnt become a global economic laggard.
0	They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia, India and China, as well as with the economic might of the United States.
0	Thats why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on Wednesday, by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok.
0	Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception.
0	His conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.
0	Lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises, his report said.The status quo is not an option. At risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built, it said.
0	The report comes at a time when Europes competitive position is waning.
0	The EUs economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next.
0	While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US.
0	But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far.
0	That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.
0	As Mr Koks report noted: The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded. The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit. The circumstances werent conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000.
0	Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so-called knowledge-based economy.The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change, said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group.What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change.
0	You find trade unions fighting change.
0	But also the employers associations.Even though they tell you theyre in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity. But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago.
0	Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report.
0	Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea.
0	The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.
0	Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing, the Kok report said.Everybody is responsible and thus no one. Thats why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth.
0	It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps theyre taking towards meeting the targets, effectively naming, shaming and faming.Rhetoric and delivery dont necessarily go hand in hand, Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report.We dont have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another. On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy.
0	The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth.
0	In that sense, the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters.
0	The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.Its very ambitious, said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank.This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do.
0	Its going to require quite new and innovative policies. But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesnt come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality.
0	For example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce.
0	But it doesnt say how companies should be convinced to do this.
0	It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Koks recommendations and press them on EU governments.
0	Mr Barroso has said that the EUs competitiveness will be his top priority.
0	He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on Europes success in meeting the Lisbon agenda.
0	Malaysia lifts Islamic bank limit Malaysias central bank is to relax restrictions on foreign ownership to encourage Islamic banking.
0	Banks in Malaysia will now be able to sell up to 49% of their Islamic banking units, while the limit on other kinds of bank remains at 30%.
0	RHB, Malaysias third-biggest lender, is already scouting for a foreign partner for its new Islamic banking unit, the firm told Reuters.
0	The moves put Malaysia ahead of a 2007 deadline to open up the sector.
0	The countrys deal to join the World Trade Organisation set that year as a deadline for liberalisation of Islamic banking.
0	Also on Tuesday, the central bank released growth figures showing Malaysias economy expanded 7.1% in 2004.
0	But growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter to 5.6%, and the central bank said it expected 6% expansion in 2005.
0	Malaysia changed the law to allow Islamic banking in 1983.
0	It has granted licences to three Middle Eastern groups, which - along with local players - mean there are eight fully-operational Islamic banking groups in the country.
0	Islamic banks offer services which permit modern banking principles while sticking to Islamic laws ban on the payment of interest.
0	Most of the Malays which make up half the countrys population are Muslims.
0	Alfa Romeos to get GM engines Fiat is to stop making six-cylinder petrol engines for its sporty Alfa Romeo subsidiary, unions at the Italian carmaker have said.
0	The unions claim Fiat is to close the Fiat Powertrain plant at Arese near Milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from General Motors.
0	Fiat has yet to comment on the matter, but the unions say the new engines will be made by GM in Australia.
0	The news comes a week after GM pulled out of an agreement to buy Fiat.
0	GM had to pay former partner Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian carmaker outright.
0	Fiat and GM also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing, but did agree to continue buying each others engines.
0	Powertrain told us today that Alfa Romeo engines will no longer be made in Arese, said union leader Vincenzo Lilliu, as reported by the Reuters news agency.The assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder Alfa Romeo motor will be replaced with an engine GM produces in Australia. Reuters also said that Mr Lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at Fiat chairman Luca di Montezemolo, following a meeting on Tuesday regarding the future of the Arese plant.
0	The unions said the end of engine production at the facility would mean the loss of 800 jobs.
0	All Alfa Romeo models can be bought with a six-cylinder engine - the 147, 156, 156 Sportwagon, 166, GTV, GT and Spider.
0	Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden General Motors, the worlds largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.
0	The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.
0	It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster.
0	As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.
0	GMs announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factorys closure.
0	The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GMs planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations.
0	But the groups new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the groups Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany.
0	They may now have to face a larger proportion of GMs cuts.
0	Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saabs failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market.
0	For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar.
0	The segments leaders do not agree.
0	GMs plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers.
0	In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge.
0	Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe.
0	Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe.
0	There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.
0	Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.
0	That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year.
0	Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts.
0	Another way to further reduce Saabs losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car.
0	Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers.
0	But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward.We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today, the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.
0	The current trend towards US production was stupid, he said.
0	In a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models.
0	It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours.
0	It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US.
0	GM said it wanted to change customers perceptions about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.
0	Shares hit by MS drug suspension Shares in Elan and Biogen Idec plunged on Monday as the firms suspended sales of new multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri after a patients death in the US.
0	On the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Ireland-based Elan lost 70% while US partner Biogen Idec shed 43%.
0	The firms took action after the death from a central nervous system disease and a suspected case of the condition.
0	The cases cited involved the use of both Tysabri and Avonex, Biogen Idecs existing multiple sclerosis drug.
0	The companies said they have no reports of the rare condition - progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - in patients taking either Tysabri or Avonex alone.
0	Tysabri was approved for use in the US last November and was widely tipped to become the worlds leading multiple sclerosis treatment.
0	The companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate Tysabri-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML, the two firms said in a statement.The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability. Analysts had believed the product would provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen Idec, which had faced increased competition from rivals to Avonex.
0	Elan, once the biggest firm on the Irish stock exchange, was also expected to receive a boost, from the new product.
0	An inquiry into Elans accounts in 2002 brought the group close to bankruptcy but the firm has been rebuilding itself since, with its share price increasing by almost four-fold last year.Most of the value in the company was in Tysabri, said Ian Hunter at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin.Now theres a question mark over it. Elan finished down $18.90 at $8, while Biogen fell $28.63 to $38.65.
0	- Shares in UK pharmaceutical firm Phytopharm closed down 19.84% at 151.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, after it said a partner was set to pull out of a deal on an experimental Alzheimers disease treatment.
0	Phytopharm said Japans Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical was likely to end a licensing agreement, prompting analysts to raise questions over the level of its future cash reserves.
0	Bank voted 8-1 for no rate change The decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8-1 by the Bank of Englands rate-setting body, minutes have shown.
0	One member of the Banks Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%.
0	The news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision.
0	Worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates, the minutes showed.
0	The Banks latest inflation report, released last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending.
0	However, MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%.
0	He argued that economic growth was picking up, and that the equity, credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected.
0	The Banks minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were sufficiently to the downside to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting.
0	However, the minutes added: Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection.
0	Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon.
0	He said the minutes appeared to be trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates.If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates. However, he added, any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with MPC members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting.
0	Crude oil prices back above $50 Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.
0	Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low.
0	Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November.
0	A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday.
0	Opec members said on Tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.
0	Although below last years peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004s average of $41.48.
0	Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.
0	Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days.
0	The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it, said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast.If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher. Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia.I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this, Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libyas oil minister, told Reuters.I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel, he added.
0	Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market.
0	The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year.
0	Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.
0	House prices show slight increase Prices of homes in the UK rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in February, says the Nationwide building society.
0	The figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to 10.2%, the lowest rate since June 2001.
0	The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market.
0	At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of England figures have shown.
0	Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier.We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared, said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister.
0	There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004.
0	In November, Barclays, which owns former building society the Woolwich, forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005, followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007.
0	And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009.
0	The price of an average UK property now stands at £152,879.
0	Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said.
0	He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.
0	I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market.
0	We always thought we would see a small rise, they thought they would see a small decline. House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December.
0	This is slightly above the 0-5% range Nationwide predicts.
0	Further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday.
0	New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said.
0	The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995.
0	The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004.
0	Overall, mortgage lending rose by £7.2bn in January, marginally up on the £7.1bn rise in December.
0	Golden rule boost for Chancellor Chancellor Gordon Brown has been given a £2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule, which allows him to borrow only for investment.
0	The extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years.
0	It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election.
0	Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government. A review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by double counting some spending on roads since 1998/9.
0	Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his golden rule of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle.
0	Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget.
0	The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total.
0	Mr Letwin said: This is a very murky area...
0	There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled. The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn black hole in the nations coffers.
0	But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.
0	In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last years Budget.
0	It also said the government might narrowly miss its golden rule if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06.
0	After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m.None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years, said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.Accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course. Macys owner buys rival for $11bn US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).
0	The deal will bring together famous stores like Macys, Bloomingdales and Marshall Fields, creating the largest department store chain in the US.
0	The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn.
0	The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed.
0	Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after Mays chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January.
0	As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macys and Bloomingdales - will assume $6bn of Mays debt, bringing the deals total value to $17bn.
0	Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.
0	May has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart.
0	Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.
0	We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence, said Terry Lundgren, Federateds chairman.
0	Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May.Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up, said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnards Retail Consulting Group.
0	Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while Mays yearly sales are $14.4bn.
0	Industrial revival hope for Japan Japanese industry is growing faster than expected, boosting hopes that the countrys retreat back into recession is over.
0	Industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January from a month earlier.
0	At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997.
0	The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April 2004 on.
0	The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen.
0	Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japans economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP.
0	Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline.
0	The output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials.Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession, said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.
0	Within the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown.
0	Among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars, chemicals and electronic goods.
0	With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand.
0	Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January.
0	Khodorkovsky ally denies charges A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are false.
0	Platon Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm.
0	The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky.
0	Mr Lebedev said there were absurd contradictions in the case.
0	Opening his defence, he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include allegations of tax evasion.To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me, he told a Moscow court.
0	Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.
0	Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days.
0	Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction.
0	The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the countrys super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs.
0	Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill.
0	The companys effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in Texas.
0	Qatar and Shell in $6bn gas deal Shell has signed a $6bn (£3.12bn) deal with the Middle Eastern sheikhdom of Qatar to supply liquid natural gas (LNG) to North America and Europe.
0	The UK-Dutch group will own 30% of the project, with Qatars state oil firm owning the rest.
0	The agreement is the latest in a string of deals reached by Qatar, which is trying to make itself a regional leader in natural gas.
0	US oil giant ExxonMobil signed up for a $12.8bn deal earlier on Sunday.
0	Frances Total is expected to join the ExxonMobil scheme, dubbed Qatargas-2, on Monday, taking 5 million tonnes of LNG a year.
0	ExxonMobil will be taking some 15 million tonnes each year for 25 years from the end of 2007 under the deal.
0	Shells agreement, under the name Qatargas-4, foresees the building of new facilities to handle 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas, and 7.8 million tonnes of LNG each year from 2011 onwards.
0	India unveils anti-poverty budget India is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen.
0	Indias defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn).
0	The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the governments Communist allies onside.
0	But his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit, which he said would be 4.5% of GDP in the year to March 2005.
0	The countrys overall deficit is thought to be more than 10%, if the spending of Indias 35 states and territories is included.
0	Under the fiscal responsibility law, Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year, a target he says he has now met for the current year.
0	But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%, Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new laws requirement.I was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act, he said.
0	The following year, though, would have to be back on track, he warned.
0	I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means, he said.
0	The coming years reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in Indias burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system, although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget.
0	Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament, Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in.
0	He said Indias economy grew 6.9% in 2004.
0	In his budget Mr Chidambaram has: - Increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn) - Increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn) - Announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure - Pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims - Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30% - Announced a package for the sugar industry In addition, up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the countrys foreign exchange reserves, keeping budgeted spending under control.Given the resilience of the Indian economy...
0	it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty, Mr Chidambaram said.The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty. The new Indian government, led by the Congress Party, was voted into power last May after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a human face.
0	The finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming Indias tax system while expanding the tax base.
0	As part of his reforms he has announced: - Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials - Expanded service tax net - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees ($2,300) - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees ($5,700) to 20% - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30% An annual economic survey released on Friday said India needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment, reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth.
0	But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending.
0	The Communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will.
0	In recent months, they have expressed their displeasure at the governments economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation.
0	In his last budget, Mr Chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers.
0	GM pays $2bn to evade Fiat buyout General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.
0	Fiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement.
0	But Fiats heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away.
0	The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt.
0	Fiats shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading.We now have absolute freedom to design our own future, said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.
0	Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off.
0	Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days.
0	The firm is Italys largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy.
0	For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.
0	We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat, said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.
0	The Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright.
0	German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control.
0	Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a put option to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009.
0	But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share.
0	As a result, the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM, which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab.
0	The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GMs stake to 10%.
0	Ex-Boeing director gets jail term An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (£131,961) for illegally hiring a top Air Force aide.
0	Michael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts.
0	Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts.
0	Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case.
0	The contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, was cancelled last year.
0	The Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyuns role in the procurement process.
0	Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy.
0	Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon.
0	She subsequently joined the company in January 2003.
0	Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.
0	In documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears sentencing, prosecutors blamed Boeings senior management for failing to ask key questions about the legal and ethical issues surrounding Ms Druyuns appointment.
0	Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing.
0	However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal.
0	The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.
0	Boeings corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years.
0	Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition.
0	Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures.
0	The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.
0	Verizon seals takeover of MCI Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (£3.6bn), reports say.
0	The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest.
0	The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn.
0	MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom.
0	The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.
0	Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs.
0	Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud.
0	Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.
0	MCI is the USs second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T.
0	Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.
0	A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October.
0	Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn.
0	Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCIs global network and business-based subscribers.
0	The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBCs AT&T deal.
0	Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.
0	US data sparks inflation worries Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.
0	New figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts.
0	But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns.
0	In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip.
0	The universitys index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public.
0	The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poors 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.
0	The economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures.
0	The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.
0	Mr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures.The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace, said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management.But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that. Consumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed.
0	However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years.The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates, said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poors.
0	But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was much less alarming than at first glance.
0	One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which are no indication of broad PPI pressure, were responsible for the increase, he said.
0	Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said it is a good bet these increases wont stick.
0	Yukos sues four firms for $20bn Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last years forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas.
0	Yukos is claiming more than $20bn (£11bn) in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes.
0	The four companies named in the law suit are gas giant Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, investment company Baikal, and state oil firm Rosneft.
0	Yukos submitted the suit in Houston, where it filed for bankruptcy.
0	As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator.
0	It also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
0	The clash between Yukos and the Kremlin came to a head last year when Yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines.
0	To settle the bill, Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas.
0	Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business.
0	It also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets.
0	Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn.
0	Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos legal wrangling as meaningless.
0	In Houston, bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 February to hear arguments on whether a US court is the proper forum for the case.
0	The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last years auction, however.
0	Concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and Yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group.
0	A few days later, Baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn.
0	Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russias very profitable oil business back under state control.
0	Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
0	Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russias richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.
0	Consumer spending lifts US growth US economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, helped by strong consumer spending, official figures have shown.
0	The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the July to September period, the Commerce Department said.
0	The figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters.
0	The increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year.It was a little softer than the consensus, but not a real surprise, said Gary Thayer, an economist at AG Edwards & Sons.
0	Fridays growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 November presidential election.
0	Democrat challenger John Kerry has criticised President George W Bushs handling of the economy, pointing to a net loss of over 800,000 jobs since Mr Bush took office.
0	Analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation.Its a pretty good growth rate, but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs, said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York.
0	However, President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth.
0	Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US.
0	The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said.The economy regained some traction in the third quarter, but the growth is not robust, AG Edwards Thayer.I think that means the Fed can take its time raising rates.
0	Well probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year. In an effort to pre-empt rising inflation, the Federal Reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since June this year, taking borrowing costs to 1.75%.
0	On the financial markets, the dollar fell slightly against the euro and the yen, while the Dow Jones index of leading US shares was little changed.
0	Crossrail link to get go-ahead The £10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday.
0	It says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly.
0	The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link.
0	The paper says it will go before the House of Commons on 23 February.
0	A second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March.Weve always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case, the Department for Transport said on Sunday.
0	Jeremy de Souza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest £7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.
0	However, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.
0	The new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City.
0	Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube.
0	The line has the support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded.
0	The Mail on Sundays Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.
0	Hariri killing hits Beirut shares Shares in Solidere, the Lebanese company founded by assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri, fell 15% in renewed trading in Beirut.
0	The real estate firm, which dominates Lebanons stock exchange, ended the day down at $8.08.
0	Traders said there was some panic selling during Fridays session, the first since a three-day market closure to mourn the death of Mr Hariri.
0	Beiruts benchmark BLOM stock index closed down 7.9% at 642.80.
0	Solidere, in which Mr Hariri was a major shareholder, was the major drag on the index.
0	The company owns much of the property in central Beirut, which it restored and redeveloped following the end of Lebanons bitter 15-year civil war.Solidere should be above $10 but because of this disaster it is falling, said one trader.If Solidere drops much lower I would consider it a buying opportunity.
0	This is a very big company held by many Lebanese. Critics had accused Mr Hariri of using Lebanons post-war reconstruction drive for his personal financial gain.
0	But his assassination on Monday sent shudders through Lebanons business community, which saw the billionaire tycoon as the countrys best hope for economic revival.
0	Solidere posted profits of $12.5m in the first half of 2004, and its shares had been gaining in recent months.
0	Small firms hit by rising costs Rising fuel and materials costs are hitting confidence among the UKs small manufacturers despite a rise in output, business lobby group the CBI says.
0	A CBI quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in seven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing expenses.
0	The CBI also found spending on innovation, training and retraining is forecast to go up over the next year.
0	However, firms continue to scale back investment in buildings and machinery.
0	The CBI said companies are looking to the government to lessen the regulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold.Smaller manufacturers are facing an uphill struggle, said Hugh Morgan Williams, chair of the CBIs SME Council.The manufacturing sector needs a period of long-term stability in the economy. The CBI found some firms managed to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many said increases failed to keep up the rise in costs.
0	Of the companies surveyed, 30% saw orders rise and 27% saw them fall.
0	The positive balance of plus 3 compared with minus 10 in the previous survey.
0	When firms were questioned on output volume, the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - the highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when looking ahead to the next three months.
0	Buyers snap up Jet Airways shares Investors have snapped up shares in Jet Airways, Indias biggest airline, following the launch of its much anticipated initial public offer (IPO).
0	The IPO for 17.3 million shares was fully sold within 10 minutes of opening, on Friday.
0	Analysts expect Jet to raise at least 16.4bn rupees ($375m; £198m) from the offering.
0	Interest in Jets IPO has been fuelled by hopes for robust growth in Indias air travel market.
0	The share offer, representing about 20% of Jets equity, was oversubscribed, news agency Reuters reported.
0	Jet, which was founded by London-based travel agent Naresh Goyal, plans to use the cash to buy new planes and cut its debt.
0	The company has grown rapidly since it launched operations in 1993, overtaking state-owned flag carrier Indian Airlines.
0	However, it faces stiff competition from rivals and low-cost carriers.
0	Jets IPO is the first in a series of expected share offers from Indian companies this year, as they move to raise funds to help them do business in a rapidly-growing economy.
0	House prices suffer festive fall UK house prices fell 0.7% in December, according to figures from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
0	Nationally, house prices rose at an annual rate of 10.7% in December, less than the 13.7% rise the previous month.
0	The average UK house price fell from £180,126 in November to £178,906, reflecting recent Land Registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004.
0	All major UK regions, apart from Northern Ireland, experienced a fall in annual growth during December.
0	December is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of Christmas celebrations.
0	However, recent figures from the Land Registry - showing a big drop in sales between the last quarter of 2004 and the previous year - suggested the slowdown could be more than a seasonal blip.
0	The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003, the Land Registry said.
0	Although both the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Land Registry figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival.
0	After registering falls at the back-end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year.
0	Deutsche Boerse boosts dividend Deutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange that is trying to buy its London rival, has said it will boost its 2004 dividend payment by 27%.
0	Analysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to its bid for the London Stock Exchange.
0	Critics of the takeover have complained that the money could be better used by returning cash to shareholders.
0	Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; £83.3m).
0	Sales climbed to 364.4m euros, lifting revenue for the year to a record 1.45bn euros.
0	Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse has offered £1.3bn ($2.48bn; 1.88bn euros) for the London Stock Exchange.
0	Rival pan-European bourse Euronext is working also on a bid.
0	Late on Monday, Deutsche Boerse said it would lift its 2004 dividend payment to 70 euro cents (£0.48; $0.98) from 55 euro cents a year earlier.There is a whiff of a sweetener in there, Anais Faraj, an analyst at Nomura told the BBCs World Business Report.Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining that the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in their hands, paid out in dividends, Mr Faraj continued.
0	Deutsche Boerse is trying to buy them off in a sense, he said.
0	Newest EU members underpin growth The European Unions newest members will bolster Europes economic growth in 2005, according to a new report.
0	The eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said.
0	In contrast, the 12 Euro zone countries will put in a lacklustre performance, generating growth of only 1.8%.
0	The global economy will slow in 2005, the UNECE forecasts, due to widespread weakness in consumer demand.
0	It warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the United States huge current account deficit which, in turn, might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates.
0	UNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005.
0	However, total output across the Euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 1.9% to 1.8%.
0	This is due largely to the faltering German economy, which shrank 0.2% in the last quarter of 2004.
0	On Monday, Germanys BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005.
0	Separately, the Bundesbank warned that Germanys efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented huge risks given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year.
0	Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continents growth.
0	Smaller nations such as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta would also be among the continents best performing economies this year, it said.
0	The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.
0	Consumer demand will remain fragile in many of Europes largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports.In view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation, monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to wait and see, the organisation said in its report.
0	Global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the Chinese and US economies.
0	The UNECE warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the US current account deficit could cause difficulties.The orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the United States and other economies, it noted.
0	Brewers profits lose their fizz Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the worlds largest brewers, have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat.
0	Dutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide.
0	Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs.
0	Both are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature.
0	Heinekens net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; £371m) during 2004, from 798m euro a year ago.
0	It blamed weak demand in western Europe and currency losses.
0	It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its operating profits.
0	Despite the dip in profits, Heinekens sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003.
0	Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in aggressive and high-impact marketing in Europe and the US in 2005.
0	Heineken, which also owns the Amstel and Murphys stout brands, said it would also seek to cut costs.
0	This may involve closing down breweries.
0	Heineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.
0	Carlsberg, the worlds fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros).
0	Its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries.
0	Nevertheless, total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland.
0	Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year.
0	However, it also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, imported brands.We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, social and structural reasons, investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg.
0	Yangtze Electrics profits double Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of Chinas Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.
0	The firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country.
0	As a hydroelectric-power generator it has not been hurt by higher coal costs.
0	Net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 ($365m; £190m), compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003.
0	Sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier.
0	The figures topped analysts expectations, even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003.
0	Analysts forecast that it is likely to decline further this year to a rate of expansion of closer to 20%.
0	Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by Chinas booming economy.
0	The government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat.
0	That has led to an energy crunch, with demand outstripping supply.
0	Earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam, as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries.
0	A total of 30 large-scale projects have been halted across the country for similar reasons.
0	The Three Gorges Dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.
0	Its sister project, the Xiluodu Dam, is being built on the Jinshajiang - or river of golden sand as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known.
0	French consumer spending rising French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the countrys economic growth, figures revealed.
0	The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis.
0	Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase.
0	The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January, but were up 1.6% on an annual basis.
0	Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January.
0	According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December.
0	But on a year-on-year basis, the sector still saw a sales increase of 6.5%.
0	Consumer spending fuelled Frances economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy.Its a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price, Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency.
0	Meanwhile in Italy, consumer confidence rose to its highest level since October 2004.
0	Economic research group ISAE has said that Italian consumer confidence rose to 104.4 from 103.3, despite a slight deterioration in short-term sentiment.
0	GSK aims to stop Aids profiteers One of the worlds largest manufacturers of HIV/Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer African countries - back into Europe for resale at far higher price.
0	The company, GlaxoSmithKline, is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills, currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement.
0	It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way.
0	This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies.
0	They want to maintain their profits, but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-Aids drugs to the worlds poorest nations.
0	The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their governments health care systems.
0	But the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price.
0	GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging, then this trade can be substantially reduced.
0	The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit, as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade.
0	Glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe.
0	Optimism remains over UK housing The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.
0	B&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market.
0	The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to £280.2m ($532m).
0	Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to £450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.
0	Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth.
0	Last week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.
0	But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market.
0	Overall, B&B said that housing market fundamentals remain strong.Interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels, real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term. Despite the upbeat tone, shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.
0	Wimpeys profit figures came in at the top of expectations, with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK.
0	Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved challenging last year.By late summer, the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn, it added.
0	However, the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs, Wimpey said.Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations. Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.
0	Russia WTO talks make progress Talks on Russias proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been making good progress say those behind the negotiations.
0	But the chairman of the working party, Ambassador Stefan Johannesson of Iceland, warned that there was still a lot of work has to be done.
0	His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry.
0	But he said for Russia to make progress the government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law.
0	His comments come three days before he is due to meet President Vladimir Putin.
0	Russia has been waiting for a decade to join the WTO and hopes to finally become a member by early 2006.
0	A decision could be reached in December, when the WTOs 148 current members gather for a summit in Hong Kong.
0	That would allow an earliest date for membership of January 2006, if the Hong Kong summit gave its approval.
0	While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia, the US said the meeting was much more efficient than weve seen for some time.
0	And Australia said it was one of the best (meetings) we can recall in terms of substance.
0	Mr Johannesson also said progress on the bilateral market access side is accelerating.
0	Sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses, as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting, piracy, and data protection.
0	Some WTO members also dislike Russias energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage.
0	Irish duo could block Man Utd bid Irishmen JP McManus and John Magnier, who own a 29% stake in Manchester United, will reportedly reject any formal £800m offer for the club.
0	The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph say they will oppose any formal £800m takeover bid from US tycoon Malcom Glazer.
0	Mr Glazer got permission to look at the clubs accounts last week.
0	Irish billionaires Mr McManus and Mr Magnier are said to believe that an £800m bid undervalues club prospects.
0	Mr Magnier and Mr McManus, who hold their stake through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid.
0	Mr Glazers financial backers, including JP Morgan, the US investment bank have said they wont back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the clubs shares.
0	However, there has been much speculation that the Irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough.
0	Mr Glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003.
0	Mr Magnier and Mr McManus issued a statement late on Friday saying that they remained long-term investors in Man Utd.
0	The Sunday Telegraph says the board of Manchester United also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it.
0	Dollar drops on reserves concerns The US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.
0	Comments by South Koreas central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines.
0	South Korea, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar.
0	Analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar.
0	At 1300 GMT, the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar.
0	The British pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level, while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the Japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.
0	At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery.
0	Analysts, however, pointed to the dollars inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the USs economic problems had not disappeared.
0	The focus once again has been on the countrys massive trade and budget deficits, with predictions of more dollar weakness to come.The comments from Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening, said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial.
0	On Tuesday, traders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session.
0	Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, chief currency strategist at UBS, said that there was a sentiment in the market that central banks from Asia and the Middle East are buying euros.
0	A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability.
0	Compiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UKs Royal Bank of Scotland, the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings, with 29 cutting back on the US dollar.
0	India and Russia in energy talks India and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part of a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects.
0	On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and Indias ONGC.
0	The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos.
0	It is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas.
0	The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft.
0	Russian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and Indias petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.
0	The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia.
0	ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea.
0	India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.
0	ONGCs Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year.At current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good, he told Reuters.What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money.The investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so. Russian news agencies reported that Indias petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday.
0	ONGCs Mr Raha declined to be drawn on his firms reported interest in the company.
0	However, he stressed that ONGC was not interested in a loan-for-oil deal in connection to Yugansk, similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and Chinas National Petroleum Corporation.Chinas problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries.
0	We do not.
0	We would like long-term security through equity participation. It is thought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection.
0	Yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk, auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill.
0	It has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary.
0	Weak data buffets French economy A batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the French economys future prospects.
0	Official figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in October.
0	At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth.[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence, he said.
0	World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.
0	Analysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff.[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment, said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires.Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late. Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies.
0	Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours.
0	The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment.
0	That is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.
0	Business fears over sluggish EU economy As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.
0	Lille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of France at the weekend.
0	But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like northern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990.
0	Beck-Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille.
0	The company has not laid off a worker since 1945.
0	It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in Europe these days.
0	Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in China and India.In our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200, he says.
0	It isnt just globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours.
0	But at least there is still a steel industry.
0	Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling.
0	New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.
0	That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille.
0	In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas it is 15%.
0	They dont see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes, he says.
0	Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here.
0	The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world.
0	Much of that trade passes through the worlds largest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec.
0	Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.
0	Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home.In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%, he says.
0	Mr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand.
0	He much preferred the old currencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each countrys economic performance.
0	In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment.
0	Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%.
0	In Britain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in recent years.
0	With Germany making up a third of the eurozones economy, this is a major problem.
0	If Germany doesnt once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be.
0	However, at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing.
0	The Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff.
0	Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to Hungary.
0	Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity by nearly 30%.
0	But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China.
0	The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University.Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem.
0	If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half, he says.
0	The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010.
0	Four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.
0	M&S cuts prices by average of 24% Marks & Spencer has cut prices in London and the regions by an average of 24%, according to research from a City investment bank.
0	Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said: In spite of the snow in the UK, it still feels very early to be cutting prices of spring merchandise. Stuart Rose, head of M&S, said last year its prices were too high.We are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market retailers like Next, said M&S.
0	Next is one of M&Ss biggest competitors and the move may force it to lower prices.
0	DrKW said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term step change in pricing in certain areas at M&S.Either way, this cannot be good news for M&S margin, it added.We have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of Stuart Roses strategy of quality, style -and price, said the M&S spokesman.
0	Many analysts believe February is proving to be a difficult month for retailers and British Retail Consortium figures, due in a few weeks, are expected to reflect the tough trading environment.
0	Separately, investment bank Goldman Sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of 35 M&S goods is now 11% above the high-street average, compared with 43% higher last year.
0	It has been a strange week for M&S, which on Tuesday received a statement from Philip Green, the billionaire Bhs owner, confirming he was not rebidding for the company.
0	This was followed the same day by Mark Paulsmeier, a South African financier, issuing a press release saying his Paulsmeier Group was interested in M&S.
0	A sudden spike in M&Ss share price followed.
0	However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid.
0	He also said the Takeover Panel and the UKs financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority had been in touch with M&S at the beginning of the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments.
0	US bank loses customer details The Bank of America has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are US federal employees.
0	Several members of the US Senate are among those affected, who could now be vulnerable to identity theft.
0	Senate sources say the missing tapes may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers.
0	The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused.
0	Customers accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any unusual activity was detected, bank officials said.
0	Bank of America said the tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre.We, with federal law authorities, have done a very robust, thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost, Alexandra Tower, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based bank, told Time magazine.
0	But although there was no evidence of criminal activity, the bank said, the Secret Service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss.
0	New York Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by the Senate Rules Committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane.Whether it is identity theft, terrorism, or other theft, in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions, the Democrat senator said.
0	Details of his Vermont colleague Pat Leahys credit card account are among those missing, Senator Leahys spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said.
0	About 900,000 military and civilian staff at the defence department are among the 1.2 million affected, according to a Pentagon spokesman.
0	Huge rush for Jet Airways shares Indian airline Jet Airways initial public offering was oversubscribed 16.2 times, bankers said on Friday.
0	Over 85% of the bids were at the higher end of the price range of 1,050-1,125 rupees ($24-$26).
0	Jet Airways, a low-fare airline, was founded by London-based ex-travel agent Naresh Goya, and controls 45% of the Indian domestic airline market.
0	It sold 20% of its equity or 17.2 million shares in a bid to raise up to $443m (£230.8m).
0	The price at which its shares will begin trading will be agreed over the weekend, bankers said.The demand for the IPO was impressive.
0	We believe that over the next two years, the domestic aviation sector promises strong growth, even though fuel prices could be high, said Hiten Mehta, manager of merchant banking firm, Fortune Financial Services.
0	India began to open up its domestic airline market - previously dominated by state-run carrier Indian Airlines - in the 1990s.
0	Jet began flying in 1993 and now has competitors including Air Deccan and Air Sahara.
0	Budget carriers Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet are planning to launch operations in May this year.
0	Jet has 42 aircraft and runs 271 scheduled flights daily within India.
0	It recently won government permission to fly to London, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.
0	Bank payout to Pinochet victims A US bank has said it will donate more than $8m to victims of former Chilean military ruler Augusto Pinochets regime under a Madrid court settlement.
0	Riggs Bank will put money in a special fund to be managed by a Madrid-based charity, the Salvador Allende Foundation, which helps abused victims.
0	The bank had been accused of illegally concealing Gen Pinochets assets.
0	More than 3,000 people were killed for political reasons under Gen Pinochets regime, an official report says.
0	Last month in a US court, Riggs Bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by Gen Pinochet and the government of Equatorial Guinea.
0	On that occasion, it was ordered to pay a fine of $16m.
0	Gen Pinochet himself has never been put on trial for human rights violations under his 1973-90 rule, despite several high-profile cases against him.
0	He is now facing charges relating to the murder of one Chilean and the disappearance of nine others.
0	He is also being investigated for tax evasion, tax fraud and embezzlement of state funds.
0	The generals opponents rejoiced at the settlement, which was agreed in a court in the Spanish capital, Madrid.
0	A lawyer for the victims, Eduardo Contreras, told Reuters news agency: This demonstrates that the horrors of the Pinochet dictatorship are not a mystery to anyone and that the whole world knows his victims deserve reparations. Riggs spokesman Mark Hendrix said the settlement, details of which will be announced next week, was an opportunity to move on.This enables the institution to put the matter behind us, he told Reuters.
0	The settlement follows a legal complaint filed against the bank by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon alleging that it had illegally concealed assets.
0	The bank agreed to create a fund for the victims, but the charges were dropped.
0	Qwest may spark MCI bidding war US phone company Qwest has said it will table a new offer for MCI after losing out to larger rival Verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.
0	MCI accepted a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant Verizon on Monday, rejecting a higher offer from Qwest.
0	Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCIs board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizons bid.
0	Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm.
0	Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers.
0	Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.
0	Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn.We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI, the letter from Qwest said.
0	Verizons offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI.
0	Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share.
0	Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval.
0	As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizons.
0	The takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.
0	Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn.
0	There may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April.
0	Verizon is far bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division.
0	Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.
0	Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud.
0	Qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy.
0	Fiat chief takes steering wheel The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control of its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around.
0	Sergio Marchionne has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat Auto, with Mr Demel leaving the company.
0	Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years.
0	Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales.
0	The car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its break-even target from 2005 to 2006.
0	The management changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following Fiats resolution of its dispute with General Motors.
0	As part of a major restructuring, Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently owned by Ferrari - within its own operations.
0	Ferrari, in which Fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007.
0	Mr Marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said Fiat Auto was now the principal focus of his attention.I have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the companys recovery, he said.A profound cultural transformation is underway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more agile and efficient structure, he added.
0	Although Mr Marchionne does not have a background in the car industry, he has been playing an increasing role in the groups activities.
0	Last year, he said that a series of new models, launched as part of the groups recovery plan, had not boosted revenues as much as hoped.
0	The car business, best known for its Alfa Romeo marque, is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004.
0	Sales are expected to fall in 2005, Fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market.
0	Mr Demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in November 2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe Morchio.
0	Mr Morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the death of president Umberto Agnelli.
0	However, this was rejected by the founding Agnelli family and Mr Morchio subsequently resigned.
0	Earlier this week, Fiat reached an agreement with GM to dissolve an alliance which could have obliged GM to buy the Italian firm outright.
0	GM will pay Fiat $2bn as part of the settlement.
0	Consumers drive French economy Frances economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004, driven by consumer spending, a report shows.
0	Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period, the statistical office INSEE said.
0	That expansion pushed annual growth to 2.3%, the fastest rate in two years.
0	Consumer spending was up by 1.2% in the fourth quarter, and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove.
0	Analysts warned that France still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace.
0	France still has a strong economic growth, said Marc Toutai, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires.But, if we check the figures in detail, theres a problem. Consumer spending is still high.
0	But French households have spent their savings to consume.France cant sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market.
0	Theres too much of a gap between growth and employment. Unemployment levels are currently stuck at about 10%, and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts.
0	Another worry is that demand in Germany and Italy, two of Frances main trading partners, is sluggish.
0	Despite the concerns, analysts pointed out that France was outperforming the majority of its European counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years.
0	As well as strong domestic demand, exports climbed by 1.3% in the fourth quarter - the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year.Its an economic growth that seems well balanced, said Nicolas Claquin, an analyst at CCF.In the beginning of 2004, growth was mainly driven by consumer spending.
0	Here it gets contributions from investment and exports, though household consumption is still strong.But we expect overall economic growth to fall to 2.0 percent in 2005. US regulator to rule on pain drug US food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.
0	The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days.
0	The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx.
0	Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval.
0	The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.
0	Putting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.
0	Merck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on 30 September, a move which caused the firms fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (£581m), from $1.4bn a year earlier.
0	Mercks shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation.
0	Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months.
0	The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.
0	Pfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products, though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart.
0	Mercks announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise.
0	Mercks head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies.
0	He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports.Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US, Mr Kim explained.
0	On Thursday, David Graham from the FDAs Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that there really doesnt appear to be a need for Cox-2 inhibitors.
0	According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November, Vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56,000 American deaths.
0	Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place.
0	European regulators, meanwhile, ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors.
0	The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be cautious about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.
0	Yukos bankruptcy not US matter Russian authorities do not have to abide by any US court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant Yukos, a Houston court has been told.
0	Legal expert William Butler said there was no treaty between the US and Russia to recognise the others legal rulings.
0	That meant Moscow would not have to adhere to US rulings in the Yukos case.
0	Yukos says a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has a US subsidiary and local bank accounts.
0	Yukos made its surprise Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Houston in December in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of Yugansk, its main oil producing unit, by Russian authorities.
0	Yugansk was sold to help pay off a $27.5bn (£14.5bn) back tax bill.
0	It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously unknown group, which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.
0	The US courts jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft.
0	Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in a US court because Yukos has no assets in the US, apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore.
0	Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos.
0	It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft the money to bid for Yugansk.
0	US bankruptcy judge Letitia Clark, who issued an injunction in December to try and prevent the Yugansk sale, has said she will rule pretty promptly, however I do not anticipate ruling on it before next Tuesday.
0	Yukos has claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection.
0	It has claimed that Russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of Yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy Yukos and its former owner Mihkail Khodorkovsky, who is facing a 10-year prison term in Russia for fraud and tax evasion.
0	Yukos parent company, the Gibraltar-based Menatep Group, is suing Russia in Europe for $28.3bn in financial damages.
0	The company is also seeking $20bn in a separate US lawsuit against Rosneft and Gazprom for their role in the sale of Yugansk.
0	Borussia Dortmund near bust German football club and former European champion Borussia Dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail.
0	The companys shares tumbled after it said it has entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation.
0	Borussia Dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its Westfallen stadium.
0	Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control.
0	Shares in Borussia Dortmund, Germanys only stock-market listed football club, dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.
0	Fund manager Florian Hamm - Borussia Dortmunds largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run.I demand better transparency, he is quoted as saying by Germanys Manger Magazin.
0	The club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club.
0	Borussia Dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; £47m) in the 12 months through June.
0	It made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through.This is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years, said HVB analyst Peter-Thilo Halser.
0	The club appointed an auditor, who has recommended a number of steps, including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year.
0	Stephen Schechter, a UK investment banker who has held talks with Borussia Dortmund over a possible bond sale, said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.They need strong people on the board who do not have a history with the club, he said.
0	Post-Christmas lull in lending UK mortgage lending showed a post-Christmas lull in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said.
0	Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply.
0	The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at £17.9bn, compared with £21.8bn in January last year.
0	The BSA said mortgage approvals - loans approved but not yet made - were £2bn, down from £2.6bn in January 2004.
0	At the same time, the British Bankers Association (BBA) said lending was weaker.
0	Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by £4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the £5.1bn seen in December.
0	This was a return to the weaker pattern of lending seen in the last months of 2004, the BBA added.
0	However, it is the year-on-year lending comparisons which are the most striking.
0	The CML said lending for house purchases and gross mortgage lending were 29% and 18% lower year-on-year respectively.These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market, Peter Williams, CML deputy director, said.
0	UK risks breaking golden rule The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its golden rule, a report suggests.
0	The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects.
0	The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about £10bn if state finances are to be put in order.
0	The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008.
0	According to NIESR, if the governments current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is unlikely the golden rule will be met.
0	Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to 50/50.
0	Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said.
0	The report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections.
0	Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Browns forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.
0	It claimed revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts.
0	A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond.Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable. Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.
0	It said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the world economy will continue to grow strongly.
0	Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006.
0	The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan.
0	Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone is expected to pick up speed.
0	Growth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast.Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006, NIESR said, adding that the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery.
0	GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006.
0	The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UKs much analysed and fretted over property market.
0	Worldcom director ends evidence The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has finished giving evidence at the trial of his ex-boss Bernie Ebbers.
0	Scott Sullivan admitted to jurors he was willing to commit fraud to meet Wall Street earnings projections.
0	Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldComs collapse in 2002.
0	He pleads not guilty.
0	Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers.
0	Attorney Reid Weingarten has attempted to portray Mr Sullivan as a liar and on Thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts profit estimates.At that point in time, Mr Sullivan said, referring to the first false entries in late 2000, I knew it was wrong and I knew it was against the law, but I thought we would get through it in the short term. Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness.
0	Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldComs finances.
0	The former finance officer said Mr Ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue.
0	Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.
0	WorldComs problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies.
0	Prosecutors allege that the companys top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period.
0	WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.
0	On Monday, MCI agreed to a buyout by Verizon Communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.
0	Ukraine steel sell-off illegal The controversial sell-off of a Ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal, a court has ruled.
0	The mill, Krivorizhstal, was sold in June 2004 for $800m (£424m) - well below other offers.
0	President Viktor Yushchenko, elected in December, is planning to revisit many of Ukraines recent privatisations.
0	Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.
0	On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.
0	Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises.
0	More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled.
0	Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence.
0	Thursdays ruling by a district court in Perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale.
0	The consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by Viktor Pinchuk, son-in-law of former-President Leonid Kuchma, and Rinat Akhmetov, the countrys richest man.
0	The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold.
0	Mr Yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $3bn.
0	One of the foreign bidders who lost out, steel giant LNM, told BBC News that it would be interested in any renewed sale.
0	Cairn shares up on new oil find Shares in Cairn Energy have jumped 6% after the firm said an Indian oilfield was larger than previously thought.
0	Cairn said drilling to the north-west of its development site in Rajasthan had produced very strong results.
0	The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years.
0	Cairns share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update.
0	Decembers share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month.
0	Cairns shares closed up 64 pence, or 6%, at 1130p on Thursday.
0	Before Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.
0	However, on Thursday, the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct.This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong, Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said.
0	Chief executive Bill Gammell added: The more we progress in Rajasthan the better we feel about it. Cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities.
0	The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries.
0	It also said production at its other fields across the globe was likely to surpass levels seen in 2004.
0	Georgia plans hidden asset pardon Georgia is offering a one-off tax amnesty to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.
0	The countrys new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax.
0	The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgias flagging economy.
0	Georgias black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.
0	Mr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible.
0	It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgias fragile public finances.
0	The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected.There are people who have money but are afraid to show it, the president told a government session.Documentation about where this money came from doesnt exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible. By declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to legalise their property, Mr Saakashvili stressed.
0	No one will have the right to check this moneys origin.
0	This money must go back into the economy. The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering.
0	Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue.
0	Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish.
0	Georgias economy is in a desperate condition.
0	Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day.
0	The unemployment rate is around 20% while the country has a $1.7bn public debt.
0	Cuba winds back economic clock Fidel Castros decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cubas ailing economy.
0	All conversions between the US dollar and Cubas convertible peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax.
0	Cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in Cuba, will be affected.
0	Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the Cuban presidents desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise.
0	In a live television broadcast announcing the measure, President Castros chief aide said it was necessary because of the United States increasing economic aggression.The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country, he said.
0	The Bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on Cuba in recent months.
0	President Bushs government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba, introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May.
0	Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives.
0	A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castros tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture.I think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash, says Jose Barrionuevo, head of strategy for Latin American emerging markets for Barclays Capital.It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue. The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home.
0	This money, known as remittances, can amount to as much as $1bn a year.
0	Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax.
0	Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax, such as euros, or increase their dollar payments to compensate.
0	However, many of Cubans poorest citizens could be worse off as a result.
0	The tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit Cuba every year, particularly those Americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.
0	Cubas tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and, according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, is now worth $3bn to the country.
0	The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cubas cash-strapped economy.
0	Cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food, fuel and medicine.
0	Much of Cubas basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair.
0	In recent weeks, Cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island.
0	Cubas economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the Soviet Union forced it to embrace foreign capital, decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise.
0	However, a decline in foreign tourism since 2002, periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy.
0	It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the governments economic problems.
0	The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, Mr Barrionuevo said.The main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries, like Venezuela, which have restrictions on capital, he says.
0	Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity.It is intended to be a permanent measure but I am not sure it can last too long. Novartis hits acquisition trail Swiss drugmaker Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn; £3.9bn) of purchases to make its Sandoz unit the worlds biggest generic drug producer.
0	Novartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had bought all of Germanys Hexal.
0	It also acquired 67.7% of Hexals US affiliate Eon Labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each.
0	Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions.
0	Novartis shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss francs in early trading.
0	The deal will see Novartis Sandoz business overtake Israels Teva Pharmaceuticals as the worlds biggest maker of generics.
0	Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn, the company estimated.
0	Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts.
0	The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force, the firm said in a statement.
0	Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals.
0	Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost.
0	There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented.
0	However, not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal.This is a very expensive acquisition, Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters.I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure. MCI shareholder sues to stop bid A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.
0	The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid.
0	MCIs directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money.
0	They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders of maximum value.
0	According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom.
0	Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn.
0	A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizons offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company.
0	Fridays lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCIs network, assets and clients.
0	MCIs directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division.
0	Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.
0	In 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal.
0	However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April.
0	It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers.
0	MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war.
0	A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.
0	Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.
0	Standoff on Deutsches LSE bid Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchanges management until May, Reuters says.
0	The Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the groups chairman and chief executive.
0	But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until Mays annual general meeting.
0	Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid.We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management.
0	We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time, Atticus David Slager told the Sunday Times.
0	However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: TCIs request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25. The Sunday Times reported that TCI had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace Deutsches chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert.
0	The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchanges management.
0	Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid.
0	TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback.
0	Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange.
0	Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out.
0	However, any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pairs takeover proposals.
0	Bush to outline toughest budget President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress, seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit.
0	About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit.
0	Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq.
0	Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the tightest so far.
0	At the heart of the administrations fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures.
0	These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.
0	Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bushs first term.
0	Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was fair and responsible.It is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society, he said.
0	The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit.
0	The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.
0	Education, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.
0	Most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nations poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m.
0	Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by as much as originally planned.
0	President Bushs proposals would see the Pentagons budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.
0	The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.
0	Also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administrations radical proposed overhaul of social security provision.
0	Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period.
0	Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.
0	John McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit.With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget, he said.
0	However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009.The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes, he said.
0	Orange colour clash set for court A row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant Orange launched action against a new mobile venture from Easyjets founder.
0	Orange said it was starting proceedings against the Easymobile service for trademark infringement.
0	Easymobile uses Easygroups orange branding.
0	Founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has pledged to contest the action.
0	The move comes after the two sides failed to come to an agreement after six months of talks.
0	Orange claims the new low-cost mobile service has infringed its rights regarding the use of the colour orange and could confuse customers - known as passing off.
0	Our brand, and the rights associated with it are extremely important to us, Orange said in a statement.In the absence of any firm commitment from Easy, we have been left with no choice but to start an action for trademark infringement and passing off. However, Mr Haji-Ioannou, who plans to launch Easymobile next month, vowed to fight back, saying: We have nothing to be afraid of in this court case.It is our right to use our own corporate colour for which we have become famous during the last 10 years. The Easyjet founder also said he planned to add a disclaimer to the Easygroup website to ensure customers are aware the Easymobile brand has no connection to Orange.
0	The new service is the latest venture from Easygroup, which includes a chain of internet cafes, budget car rentals and an intercity bus service.
0	Easymobile will allow customers to go online to order SIM cards and airtime - which will be rented from T-Mobile - for their existing handsets.
0	Standard Life cuts policy bonuses Standard Life, Europes largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.
0	Annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%.
0	It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004.
0	The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.
0	With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility.
0	Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly.
0	Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies.
0	Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002.
0	The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered.
0	Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.
0	John Gill, managing director of the insurers life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002.
0	In addition, low interest rates meant that long-term investment returns are well below historic levels, Mr Gill added.
0	However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term.Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods, he said.
0	Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders.
0	Last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.
0	EMI shares hit by profit warning Shares in music giant EMI have sunk by more than 16% after the firm issued a profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases.
0	EMI said music sales for the year to March will fall 8-9% from the year before, with profits set to be 15% lower than analysts had expected.
0	It blamed poor sales since Christmas and delays to the releases of new albums by Coldplay and Gorillaz.
0	By 1200 GMT on Monday, EMI shares were down 16.2% at 235.75 pence.
0	EMI said two major albums scheduled for release before the end of the financial year in March - one by Coldplay and one by Gorillaz - have now had their release dates put back.
0	EMI Musics sales, particularly re-orders, in January have also been lower than anticipated and this is expected to continue through February and March, the company added.Therefore, for the full year, at constant currency, EMI Musics sales are now expected to be 8% to 9% lower than the prior year. The company said it expected profits to be about £138m ($259.8m).
0	Alain Levy, chairman and chief executive of EMI Music, described the performance as disappointing, but added that he remained optimistic over future trends in the industry.The physical music market is showing signs of stabilisation in many parts of the world and digital music, in all its forms, continues to develop at a rapid pace, he said.
0	Commenting on the delay to the release of the Coldplay and Gorillaz albums, Mr Levy said that creating and marketing music is not an exact science and cannot always coincide with our reporting periods.While this rescheduling and recent softness is disappointing, it does not change my views of the improving health of the global recorded music industry, he added.
0	Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis Securities, said the market would be focusing on the slump in music sales rather than the timing of the two albums.Its unusual to see this much of a downgrade just because of phasing, he said.
0	Chinas Shanda buys stake in Sina Chinese online game operator Shanda Interactive Entertainment has bought a 20% stake in Sina, the countrys biggest internet portal firm.
0	The move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in Sina.
0	Shanda said that it may boost its stake in Sina, even buying it outright.
0	A merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games, news, entertainment and wireless messaging.
0	Sina said that the purchase of a stake by Shanda would have no impact on its business.
0	The board of directors said in a statement that it would continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers.
0	Both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchanges (NYSE) technology-dominated Nasdaq index.
0	In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sina said its shares were purchased between 12 January and 10 February for about $230m.
0	Rumours about a possible takeover boosted Sinas shares by more than 10% on Friday.
0	They added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished.
0	And there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in New York on Tuesday after Mondays public holiday, analysts forecast.There could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid, said Wallace Cheung, an analyst at DBS Vickers.Even though Shanda has 20% of Sina, they still have quite a long way to take full control. However, Mr Cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a Chinese internet portal firm, with its ability to filter and pass on news, may not be viewed very favourably by Beijing.
0	Mixed reaction to Man Utd offer Shares in Manchester United were up over 5% by noon on Monday following a new offer from Malcolm Glazer.
0	The board of Man Utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the US tycoon that values the club at £800m ($1.5bn).
0	Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer.
0	A senior source at the club told the BBC: This time its different.
0	The board is obliged to consider this deal.
0	But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal.
0	Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters group, Shareholders United.
0	They have all spoken out against the bid.
0	A spokesman for the supporters club said: I cant see any difference (compared to Mr Glazers previous proposals) other than £200m less debt.He isnt bringing any money into the club; hell use our money to buy it. Mr Glazers latest move is being led by Mr Glazers two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times.
0	A proposal was received by David Gill, Uniteds chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share.
0	David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a well funded 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it, he told the BBC.They can complain about it but it is curtains for them.
0	They may not want him but they are going to get him. The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with detailed proposals, it has confirmed.
0	Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted.
0	He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much.
0	For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of Uniteds largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier.
0	They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle.
0	Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%.
0	But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid.
0	NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times.
0	His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice.
0	But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazers latest financial proposal.
0	Gold falls on IMF sale concerns The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.
0	By revaluing its holdings, the IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the worlds poorest nations.
0	The plan was put forward by G7 finance ministers over the weekend.
0	The price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in Asia, before rebounding slightly in early European trading.
0	IMF boss Rodrigo Rato was asked by G7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.
0	He is expected to present his conclusions at an IMF meeting in Washington during April.Whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the April IMF meetings, said John Reade, an analyst at UBS.
0	The IMF values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce, a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metals current market value.
0	The IMF has 3,217 tonnes of gold, or about 113.5m ounces.
0	Bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the IMFs balance sheet, giving it more money to distribute.
0	This idea has been put forward before, but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty.This is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a G7 communiqu&#233; for achieving debt relief, said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.
0	At their meeting in London, G7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the worlds poorest countries.
0	Mr Brown said the meeting would be remembered as the 100% debt relief summit.
0	While debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda, not everyone is convinced that selling IMF gold is the best way forward.
0	The US, which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold should it so choose, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem.The US is not convinced thats the necessary way to do it, said Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor.
0	Canada, a key gold producer, also expressed reservations.
0	Electronics firms eye plasma deal Consumer electronics giants Hitachi and Matshushita Electric are joining forces to share and develop technology for flat screen televisions.
0	The tie-up comes as the worlds top producers are having to contend with falling prices and intense competition.
0	The two Japanese companies will collaborate in research & development, production, marketing and licensing.
0	They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally.
0	Plasma display panels are used for large, thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions.
0	The display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of Sony and Samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (LCDs).
0	The deal will enable Hitachi and Matsushita, which makes Panasonic brand products, to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness.
0	Hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival Fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.
0	Separately, Fujitsu announced on Monday that it is quitting the LCD panel market by transferring its operations in the area to Japanese manufacturer Sharp.
0	Sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from Fujitsu.
0	The plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen.
0	Samsung Electronics and Sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development.
0	MG Rover China tie-up delayed MG Rovers proposed tie-up with Chinas top carmaker has been delayed due to concerns by Chinese regulators, according to the Financial Times.
0	The paper said Chinese officials had been irritated by Rovers disclosure of its talks with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp in October.
0	The proposed deal was seen as crucial to safeguarding the future of Rovers Longbridge plant in the West Midlands.
0	However, there are growing fears that the deal could result in job losses.
0	The Observer reported on Sunday that nearly half the workforce at Longbridge could be under threat if the deal goes ahead.
0	Shanghai Automotives proposed £1bn investment in Rover is awaiting approval by its owner, the Shanghai city government and by the National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees foreign investment by Chinese firms.
0	According to the FT, the regulator has been annoyed by Rovers decision to talk publicly about the deal and the intense speculation which has ensued about what it will mean for Rovers future.
0	As a result, hopes that approval of the deal may be fast-tracked have disappeared, the paper said.
0	There has been continued speculation about the viability of Rovers Longbridge plant because of falling sales and unfashionable models.
0	According to the Observer, 3,000 jobs - out of a total workforce of 6,500 - could be lost if the deal goes ahead.
0	The paper said that Chinese officials believe cutbacks will be required to keep the MG Rovers costs in line with revenues.
0	It also said that the production of new models through the joint venture would take at least eighteen months.
0	Neither Rover nor Shanghai Automotive commented on the reports.
0	US bank boss hails genius Smith US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has given a speech at a Scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist, Adam Smith.
0	He delivered the 14th Adam Smith Lecture in Kirkcaldy, Fife.
0	The Adam Smith Lecture celebrates the author of 1776s Wealth of Nations, which became a bible of capitalism.
0	Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown, whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church.
0	Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the the worlds greatest economist.
0	Dr Greenspan, 79, who has been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith, whose genius he compared to that of Mozart.
0	He said the philosopher was a towering contributor to the modern world.Kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared.I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellors renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area. He continued: Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked.In so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living. Dr Greenspan said Smiths revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world.The incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest, he said.
0	Following his lecture, Dr Greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
0	He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education.
0	Joyce Johnston, principal of the college, said: It is very fitting that the worlds premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the worlds first economist. Dr Greenspan - who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June 2004 - will step down in January next year.
0	He has served under Presidents George W Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Ronald Reagan.
0	He was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to Gerald Ford.
0	Economy strong in election year UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.
0	Optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward.
0	The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year.
0	Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May.
0	The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October.
0	The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.
0	The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said.
0	Its BDOs output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005.
0	However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterlings strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted.
0	Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year.The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures, said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward.Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services. SEC to rethink post-Enron rules The US stock market watchdogs chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.
0	In a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised several initiatives.
0	European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.
0	The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
0	The Act comes into force in mid-2005.
0	It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.
0	Firms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years.
0	Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements.
0	There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts.
0	But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.
0	The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.
0	The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting.
0	Mr Donaldson said the SEC would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.
0	We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the US market into one with no exit, he said.
0	He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Acts least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms.
0	Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firms internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts.
0	The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).
0	A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.
0	It was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UKs Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes.
0	Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings.
0	Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (£558m) stock market debut last month.
0	There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year.
0	Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.
0	Nissan names successor to Ghosn Nissan has named a lifetime employee to run its operations after Carlos Ghosn, its highly successful boss, takes charge at Renault.
0	As chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga will run Nissan on a daily basis, although Mr Ghosn, who masterminded its recovery, will remain chief executive.
0	Mr Ghosn is to become chairman and chief executive of Renault, which owns 44% of the Japanese carmaker, in April.
0	Mr Ghosn transformed Nissan into a fast-growing and profitable business.
0	Mr Shiga will nominally serve as Mr Ghosns deputy.
0	However, he will be Nissans most senior Japan-based executive and will be in charge of the firms global sales and marketing.
0	He is currently in charge of Nissans operations across Asia and Australasia and is credited with significantly improving its sales in China.
0	He will inherit a strong legacy from Mr Ghosn, who has overseen a dramatic turnaround in Nissans fortunes in the past five years.
0	Dubbed le cost killer for pushing through huge cost cuts in previous jobs, Mr Ghosn reduced Nissans overheads by 20% and trimmed its workforce by about 200,000 after taking charge in 1999.
0	These actions helped Nissan turn a 684bn yen ($6.4bn) loss in 2000 into a 331bn yen ($2.7bn) profit the following year.
0	During his tenure, Nissan has increased its market share and made significant strides in key export markets.
0	Nissan aims to increase vehicle sales to more than four million by 2008, launching 28 new models in the process.
0	In his new job as Renault chief executive, Mr Ghosn will devote 40% of his time to Renault, 40% to Nissan and the rest to the groups activities in North America and other key markets.
0	Mr Ghosn said Mr Shigas appointment would ensure a seamless transition in management.I need a leadership team capable of accelerating the performance and delivery of results that has characterized Nissan over the past six years, Mr Ghosn said.I have full confidence in Toshiyuki Shiga and the new leadership team to help me implement the next chapter of Nissans growth. Nissan also announced a number of other management appointments with promotions for several younger executives.
0	Ukraine trims privatisation check Ukraine is to review dozens of state asset sales as the countrys new administration tackles corruption.
0	The figure announced by President Viktor Yushchenko is less than the 3,000 cases mentioned last week, but will cover many of the biggest deals.
0	Ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader Leonid Kuchma and has said it wants closer European Union links.
0	In a separate statement, the EU said that the US should back Ukraines entry into the World Trade Organisation.
0	The comments came as Viktor Yushchenko prepared to head to Brussels to meet with US President George W Bush and other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) leaders.
0	He is the only non-Nato member leader invited to attend the summit.
0	Mr Yushchenko recently defeated Moscow-backed presidential candidate and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych at the polls, and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make Ukraine more transparent.
0	Earlier this month, new Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms may have their privatisations put under the spotlight.
0	Her comments raised concerns among a number of investors and Mr Yushchenko was seen on Monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves.We acknowledge that business in Ukraine is now shaped and 98% of privatisations were carried out according to the law, Mr Yushchenko said on Monday.We have trust in this business and want to defend it by law, he continued, adding that any review would focus on dozens of companies, not hundreds or thousands.
0	He cited last years sale of Ukrainian steel producer Krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns.
0	It was sold in June 2004 to a consortium that included Viktor Pinchuk, son-in-law of former-President Kuchma, and Rinat Akhmetov, the countrys richest man, for $800m (£424m) - despite other higher offers.
0	Vice-Prime Minister Oleg Rybachuk called on the EU to recognise the steps that Ukraine was taking, fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be a backlash against closer relations with Brussels.
0	He said that while he understood that Ukraine was not ready for EU membership, the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements.We deserve an honest response, Mr Rybachuk told the Associated Press in an interview.We understand the difficulties.
0	We refuse to understand double standards. Ukraine may find it has a sympathetic ear in Brussels The EU has reiterated that we support (Ukraines) fast accession to the WTO and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year, said Claude Veron-Reville, a spokesman for EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson.We have said as much to the Americans.
0	We feel that it is important for us all to pull together for Ukraine to be allowed into the WTO.
0	Mr Yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on Russia, which borders the country to the east, saying it was important to maintain pragmatic ties with Moscow.Russia is Ukraines eternal strategic partner, Mr Yushchenko said.
0	Absa and Barclays talks continue South Africa biggest retail bank Absa has said it is still in talks with UK bank Barclays over the sale of majority stake in the group.
0	In November, Absa said it was close to striking a deal with Barclays.
0	But the group said Barclays is still waiting for the approval of South Africas banking and competition authorities to make a formal offer.
0	Absa also announced that it expects to see earnings grow by 20-25% in its current financial year.
0	Discussions with Barclays are continuing, but shareholders are advised that no agreement has been reached as to any offer being made by Barclays to acquire a majority stake in Absa, Absa said in a statement.
0	If Barclays buys a stake in Absa it will be one of the largest foreign investments in South Africa in recent years.
0	Absa currently has a market value of about $8.5bn (£4.4bn).
0	Analysts said Absas earnings forecast was better than expected.
0	However, the company warned that headline earnings growth would be trimmed by about four percentage points because of share options for a black economic empowerment transaction and a staff share incentive scheme.
0	The South African group will release its results for the year to 31 March on 30 May.
0	Rescue hope for Borussia Dortmund Shares in struggling German football club Borussia Dortmund slipped on Monday despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on Friday.
0	The club, which has posted record losses and racked up debts, said last week that it was in a life-threatening profitability and financial situation.
0	Creditors agreed on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007.
0	News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday, but the stock slipped back 7% during Monday morning.
0	In addition to the interest-payment freeze, Borussia Dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries.
0	It estimated that it needs almost 30m euros ($39m; £21m) until the end of June if it is to pay its bills.
0	The football club is hoping that all its creditors will agree to defer rent payments on its Westfalen stadium.
0	Borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on Friday and over the weekend.
0	Three creditors have yet to agree to the deal struck last week.
0	On 14 March, one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the clubs stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan.
0	Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors have been pushing for a greater say in how the club is run.
0	Borussia Dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club.
0	The club posted a record loss of 68m euros in the 12 months through June.
0	Adding to its woes, Borussia Dortmund was beaten 5-0 by Bayern Munich on Saturday.
0	Standard Life concern at LSE bid Standard Life is the latest shareholder in Deutsche Boerse to express concern at the German stock market operators plans to buy the London Stock Exchange.
0	It said Deutsche Boerse had to show why its planned £1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the LSE was good for shareholder value.
0	Reports say Standard Life, which owns a 1% stake in Deutsche Boerse, may seek a shareholder vote on the issue.
0	Fellow shareholders US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital and UK-based TCI Fund Management have also expressed doubts.
0	Deutsche Boerses supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the LSE despite the signs of opposition from investors.The onus is on Deutsche Boerses management to demonstrate why the purchase of the LSE creates more value for shareholders than other strategies, such as a buyback, said Richard Moffat, investment director of UK Equities at Standard Life Investments.
0	Atticus Capital, holding 2% of Deutsche Boerse, wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the LSE.
0	And TCI which holds about 5%, has made a request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the companys entire supervisory board.
0	It has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition, and whether the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange should return $500m (£266m) to shareholders instead.
0	In December, Deutsche Boerse, which also owns the derivatives market Eurex and the clearing firm Clearstream, put an informal offer of 530 pence per LSE share on the table.
0	However, the LSE said the cash offer undervalued both its own business and the benefits of such a tie-up.
0	Since then an improved offer from Deutsche Boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with LSE chief executive Clara Furse.
0	But the London exchange is also holding talks with Deutsche Boerses rival Euronext, which operates the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris exchanges, as well as London-based international derivatives market Liffe.
0	BP surges ahead on high oil price Oil giant BP has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices.
0	Last week, rival Shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a UK-listed company.
0	BP added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents, and that it would continue with share buybacks.
0	BP chief executive Lord Browne said the results were strong both operationally and financially. The company is earning about $1.8m an hour.
0	Despite the record annual profits figure, BPs performance was below the expectations of some City analysts.
0	However, BPs share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p.
0	Its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.
0	Speaking on the BBCs Today programme on Tuesday, Lord Browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.
0	The profits are up more than the price of oil is up, he said.
0	Lord Browne pointed out that BP was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration.We have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low, he said.
0	The company has made new discoveries in Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico and Angola.
0	However, Lord Browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his companys huge profits, saying that in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax, the more profits it made.
0	Lord Browne believes oil prices will remain quite high.
0	Currently above $40 a barrel, he said: The price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term. BP put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil, up 10% on 2003, but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.
0	Oil companies get Russian setback International oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to Russias decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005.
0	US oil giant Exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement.
0	Miner Highland Gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while BP, a big investor, declined to comment.
0	Only firms at least 51% Russian-owned will be permitted to bid.
0	The Federal Natural Resources Agency said the government is interested in letting Russian companies develop strategic resources.
0	The foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to Russias competition law, natural resources minister Yuri Trutnev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
0	No further details were given, with Mr Trutnev suggesting that Russia may decide on a case-by-case basis.
0	Observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy, as the administration of Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics.
0	Russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos, a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.
0	Analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals.
0	Companies echoed this sentiment, saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells.Its not good.
0	But it is very understandable, said Al Breach, an economist at UBS Brunswick.But if the investment climate is stable - thats much more important.Foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world. A number of other nations, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, protect their national resources from foreign firms.
0	What has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism Russia has been courting foreign investment.
0	BP spent $7.5bn to create Russian-registered oil company TNK-BP, and has a partnership to develop the Sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned Rosneft.
0	Exxon, the worlds largest oil company, has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin 3 field.
0	Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block.
0	According to Mr Waller, Exxon were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway.We regret the ministry has taken such a decision, said Ivan Kulakov, deputy chairman of Highland Gold - a mining firm that has the motto Bringing Russias Gold to Market.It would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate. Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include Frances Total, the US-based ChevronTexaco, and miner Barrick Gold.
0	Gaming firm to sell UK dog tracks Six UK greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group Wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group.
0	Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US gaming division to BLB Investors.
0	US gaming consortium BLB will pay $339m (£182.5m) for the US unit, although the deal is subject to certain conditions.
0	BLB holds a 22% stake in Wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a £308m takeover deal.
0	Shares in Wembley were up 56 pence, or 7.6%, at 797p by mid-morning.
0	The sale of the US gaming unit will leave Wembley with its UK business.
0	This includes greyhound tracks at Wimbledon in London, Belle Vue in Manchester, Perry Barr and Hall Green in Birmingham, Oxford and Portsmouth.
0	Analysts have valued the six tracks at between £40m-£50m.
0	The US business accounts for about 90% of Wembleys operating profit and consists of operations in Rhode Island and Colorado.
0	BLBs purchase of the US unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with Rhode Island authorities.
0	Wembley said that, once the deal was completed, it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders.Whilst the completion of the sale of the US Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions, we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders, said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman.
0	Wembley sold the English national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations.
0	Man Utd to open books to Glazer Manchester Uniteds board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books.
0	Earlier this month, Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club.
0	In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer limited due diligence to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid.
0	But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazers plans, calling his assumptions aggressive and his plan damaging.
0	Many of Manchester Uniteds supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer.
0	About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago.
0	Rival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday.
0	Manchester Uniteds response comes as little surprise, as the board made clear.Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal, the club said in its statement.
0	Should it become a firm offer, it should be at a price that the board is likely to regard as fair and on terms which may be deliverable.
0	But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazers proposal.The board continues to believe that Mr Glazers business plan assumptions are aggressive, the statement said, and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging. Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms, in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons.
0	At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester Uniteds second biggest shareholders.
0	They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida.
0	If the family makes a formal offer, they will need the support of the clubs biggest shareholders.
0	Irish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own 29% of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression, and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.
0	A group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds.
0	They have signed a House of Commons motion, and Tony Lloyd, the Manchester Central MP, whose constituency includes the clubs Old Trafford ground, has pledged to take the matter to Tony Blair if necessary.
0	The Commons motion says any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football.
0	However, the DTI has dismissed the proposal.
0	A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds.
0	Mr Glazers offer values the club at £800m ($1.5bn).
0	Pitched at 300p per share, it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon, which was rejected out of hand.
0	Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day.
0	Sales fail to boost High Street The January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from a poor Christmas season, a survey has found.
0	Stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said.
0	Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier.
0	Consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture, said BRC director general Kevin Hawkins.
0	Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said.
0	But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month.
0	In the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said.Following a relatively strong New Years bank holiday, trading then took a downward turn, said Mr Hawkins.Even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers. The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers.
0	And according to Office for National Statistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981.
0	McDonalds to sponsor MTV show McDonalds, the worlds largest restaurant chain, is to sponsor a programme on music channel MTV as part of its latest youth market promotion.
0	The show Advance Warning highlights new talent and MTV reckons it will give McDonalds access to nearly 400 million homes in 162 countries.
0	McDonalds golden arches, name and Im loving it catchphrase will be used throughout the half-hour programme.
0	The move comes amid growing concerns about obesity in Europe and the US.
0	The European Union has called on the food industry to reduce the number of adverts aimed at young children, warning that legislation would be introduced.
0	unless voluntary steps were taken.
0	In the US, food group Kraft is among firms that already have cut back on promoting sugar and fattening products to the young.
0	McDonalds has also been taking steps to improve its junk food reputation, revamping its menu and providing clients with health-related products such as pedometers.
0	As well as burgers like the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the company now sells healthier options such as salads and fresh fruit.
0	Chief executive Jim Skinner attributed an 8.3% increase in January worldwide sales to the vitality of our menu, among other things.
0	Hooking up with MTV is expected to add extra momentum to McDonalds recent revival.
0	MTV, which played a key role in the emergence of the music video, is to show Advance Warning on all 25 of its channels across the world.
0	The programme can at present only been seen in the US, where it has featured artists like British stars Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand.
0	McDonalds has targeted the youth market in the past with its advertisements, signing up stars like jelly-legged dancer Justin Timberlake and all-woman singing group Destinys Child.
0	Call to save manufacturing jobs The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling on the government to stem job losses in manufacturing firms by reviewing the help it gives companies.
0	The TUC said in its submission before the Budget that action is needed because of 105,000 jobs lost from the sector over the last year.
0	It calls for better pensions, child care provision and decent wages.
0	The 36-page submission also urges the government to examine support other European countries provide to industry.
0	TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber called for a commitment to policies that will make a real difference to the lives of working people. Greater investment in childcare strategies and the people delivering that childcare will increases the options available to working parents, he said.A commitment to our public services and manufacturing sector ensures that we can continue to compete on a global level and deliver the frontline services that this country needs. He also called for practical measures to help pensioners, especially women who he said are most likely to retire in poverty.
0	The submission also calls for decent wages and training for people working in the manufacturing sector.
0	Tsunami to hit Sri Lanka banks Sri Lankas banks face hard times following Decembers tsunami disaster, officials have warned.
0	The Sri Lanka Banks Association said the waves which killed more than 30,000 people also washed away huge amounts of property which was securing loans.
0	According to its estimate, as much as 13.6% of the loans made by private banks to clients in the disaster zone has been written off or damaged.
0	State-owned lenders may be even worse hit, it said.
0	The association estimates that the private banking sector has 25bn rupees ($250m; £135m) of loans outstanding in the disaster zone.
0	On one hand, banks are dealing with the death of their customers, along with damaged or destroyed collateral.
0	On the other, most are extending cheap loans for rebuilding and recovery, as well as giving their clients more time to repay existing borrowing.
0	The combination means a revenue shortfall during 2005, SLBA chairman - and Commercial Bank managing director - AL Gooneratne told a news conference.Most banks have given moratoriums and will not be collecting interest, at least in this quarter, he said.
0	In the public sector, more than one in ten of the state-owned Peoples Banks customers in the south of Sri Lanka were affected, a bank spokesman told Reuters.
0	He estimated the banks loss at 3bn rupees.
0	Shares rise on new Man Utd offer Shares in Manchester United closed up 4.75% on Monday following a new offer from US tycoon Malcolm Glazer.
0	The board of the football club is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal, which values the club at £800m ($1.5bn).
0	Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer, which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny.
0	The club has previously rejected Mr Glazers approaches out of hand.
0	But a senior source at the club told the BBC: This time its different. Supporters group Shareholders United, however, urged the club to reject the new deal.
0	A spokesman for the Shareholders United said: I cant see any difference (compared to Mr Glazers previous proposals) other than £200m less debt.He isnt bringing any money into the club; hell use our money to buy it. Mr Glazers latest move is being led by Mr Glazers two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times.
0	A proposal was received by David Gill, Uniteds chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share.
0	David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a well funded 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.
0	I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it, he told the BBC.They can complain about it but it is curtains for them.
0	They may not want him but they are going to get him. The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with detailed proposals, it has confirmed.
0	Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted.
0	He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much.
0	For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of Uniteds largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier.
0	They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle.
0	Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%.
0	But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid.
0	NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times.
0	His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice.
0	But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazers latest financial proposal.
0	Yukos drops banks from court bid Russian oil company Yukos has dropped the threat of legal action against five banks it had accused of involvement in the sale of its key Yugansk unit.
0	State-owned Rosneft bought the unit for $9.3bn (£5bn) after Yukos was forced to sell assets to meet a $27.5bn tax bill.
0	Yukos says the sale was illegal and is pursuing damages in a US court.
0	Its lawyers now accept ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Calyon, JP Morgan Chase Bank, and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein were not involved in the sale financing.
0	However, Yukos still has an outstanding complaint against Deutsche Bank, which it alleges to be the leader of a consortium that was behind a bid for Yugansk by state gas monopoly Gazprom.
0	The company has also accused Gazprom, the Russian Federation and two other Russian firms.
0	Gazprom had been expected to win the December auction, but ended up not bidding.
0	Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft.
0	Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

1	A statement from the bands record company Universal said frontman Charlie Simpson planned to spend some time working with his other band, Fightstar.

1	Media seek Jackson juror notes Reporters covering singer Michael Jacksons trial in California have asked to see questionnaires completed by potential jurors.
1	Lawyers for news organisations said it was really vital for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public to serve as a check on the process.
1	Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday.
1	Mr Jackson denies child molestation.
1	It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (£2.13m).
1	Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is 100% certain her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces.
1	The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness.
1	Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.
1	The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case, a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated.
1	The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (£1.33m) to $4m (£2.13m) of local taxpayers money.
1	Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case.
1	The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (£21,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.
1	Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him.
1	His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent.
1	I believe that for one reason - I know his character, she said.
1	He loves children.

1	Destinys Child also slipped one place to four with Lose My Breath, followed by Girls Aloud at five with the Children in Need record Ill Stand By You.
1	The only other new entry in the top 10 came from Robbie Williams track Misunderstood, a new track written for his Greatest Hits album.

1	U2s How to Dismantle a Bomb remains at number one for a third week in a row, followed by Williams Greatest Hits.
1	Opera band Il Divo have moved up one place with their eponymous album to number three.

1	She was later released.
1	It was his second alleged violation, having previously served half of a nine-year sentence for breaking the terms of his parole.
1	Mr Knight, 39, was jailed in October 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting.
1	He was driving Shakurs car at the time and was shot in the head.
1	At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians.
1	Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees.
1	But the label has always been dogged by allegations it supports gang culture and fuels the east and west coast rap rivalry.

1	Wal-Mart is sued over rude lyrics The parents of a 13-year-old girl are suing US supermarket giant Wal-Mart over a CD by rock group Evanescence that contains swear words.
1	The lawsuit, filed in Washington County, alleges Wal-Mart deceived customers by not putting warning labels on the cover.
1	Trevin Skeens alleges Wal-Mart knew of the offending word because it had censored it on its music sales website.
1	Wal-Mart said it was investigating the claims but had no plans to pull the CD.
1	Wal-Mart has a policy of not stocking CDs which carry parental advisory labels.
1	Mr Skeens said he bought the Anywhere But Home CD for his daughter and was shocked to hear the swearing when it was played in their car.
1	I dont want any other families to get this, expecting it to be clean.
1	It needs to be removed from the shelves to prevent other children from hearing it, said Mr Skeens of Brownsville.
1	The lawsuit seeks to force Wal-Mart to censor the music or remove it from its stores in Maryland.
1	It also seeks damages of up to $74,500 (£38,660) for every customer who bought the CD at Maryland Wal-Marts, and also naming record label Wind-Up Records and distributor BMG Entertainment in the legal action.
1	While Wal-Mart sets high standards, it would not be possible to eliminate every image, word or topic that an individual might find objectionable, Wal-Mart spokesman Guy Whitcomb told the Herald-Mail of Hagerstown.
1	Pete Doherty misses bail deadline Singer Pete Doherty will have to spend the weekend in jail because he could not come up with £150,000 bond money for his bail on time.
1	The former Libertines singer had been granted bail with curfew restrictions at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court on charges of robbery and blackmail.
1	But his lawyer said the money could not be raised on time.
1	Mr Doherty, 25, was arrested following an alleged incident in a London hotel on Wednesday evening.
1	Musician Alan Wass, 23, also of north London, appeared in court accused of the same offences.

1	Rapper Snoop Dogg sued for rape US rapper Snoop Dogg has been sued for $25m (£13m) by a make-up artist who claimed he and his entourage drugged and raped her two years ago.
1	The woman said she was assaulted after a recording of the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show on the ABC network in 2003.

1	ABC said the claims had no merit.
1	The star has not been charged by police.
1	The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Friday, says the womans champagne was spiked and she was then assaulted.

1	We are confident that in this case, [the alleged victims] claims against Snoop Dogg will be rejected. The lawsuit names Snoop Dogg - real name Calvin Broadus - plus three associates, The Walt Disney Company and its parent company ABC Inc.
1	The woman waited two years to sue because she was trying to negotiate a settlement with the media companies, her lawyer, Perry Wander, said.
1	Disney and ABC failed to provide a safe working environment for my client, he said.
1	The legal action comes after the rap star sued a woman who claimed they tried to blackmail him to keep quiet about an alleged assault.
1	The 32-year-old rapper has enjoyed six US top 10 albums since bursting onto the music scene with hit songs like Whats My Name? and Gin and Juice in 1993.

1	The Hit Factory, which opened 37 years ago, has played host to some of the biggest stars in music, including Paul Simon, Madonna and David Bowie.
1	However, the rise in digital recording has affected business at the studio, which is relocating to smaller premises in Miami.

1	Other well-known albums to be recorded or partially recorded at the studio include Bruce Springsteens Born In The USA, the Rolling Stones Emotional Rescue and Paul Simons Graceland.
1	Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Jay-Z and Beyonce are also among artists who have used the Hit Factory in the past, as well as 50 Cent who survived an attempt on his life as he left the premises in 2000.

1	Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, said: I have inherited two of the most important brands in hip-hop, Def Jam and Roc-A-Fella.
1	I feel this is a giant step for me and the entire artist community. One of the most successful and respected rap stars of the last eight years, Jay-Zs hits have included Hard Knock Life, Dirt Off Your Shoulder and 03 Bonnie and Clyde with his girlfriend Beyonce Knowles.
1	He said he would retire after The Black Album, but has just released an album and been on an ill-fated tour with R Kelly.
1	Def Jam was founded in 1984 by Russell Simmons and producer Rick Rubin and signed artists including Run-DMC, The Beastie Boys and Public Enemy.
1	REM concerts blighted by illness US rock band REM have been forced to cancel concerts after bass player Mike Mills was taken to hospital suffering from severe flu-like symptoms.
1	The band were forced to cut short Monday nights show in Sheffield, and have cancelled Tuesdays Glasgow date.
1	Mills could hardly stand up, let alone play, said an REM spokesman, who added he is now resting in hospital.
1	The remainder of the band played a short acoustic set on Monday.
1	Tuesdays gig has been rescheduled for 15 June.
1	Those who had a ticket for the show in Glasgow are being advised to retain their ticket stub so they can attend the new date.
1	The bands spokesman said that they would review their remaining dates on a day-to-day basis, based on doctors advice to Mills.
1	Obviously we all want Mike to get better, and clearly we all want to play the shows.
1	Rest assured we will do so as soon as possible, he said.
1	The band were still hopeful they would be able to make their Wednesday date, added the spokesman.
1	REM played accoustic versions of their hits Losing My Religion, Ive Been High, Leaving New York and The One I Love to the Sheffield Arena audience on Monday.
1	The band had originally been scheduled to play four dates in the UK as part of a world tour.
1	In 1995 former drummer Bill Berry collapsed in Switzerland while the band was on tour, having suffered a ruptured aneurysm.
1	He made a full recovery, only to leave the band two years later.
1	Ring of Fire hit co-writer dies Merle Kilgore, co-writer of the country hit Ring of Fire, has died of congestive heart failure aged 70.
1	He started out as a singer and songwriter before going into music management, looking after country star Hank Williams Jr.
1	He wrote Ring of Fire with June Carter Cash, the future wife of Johnny Cash who went on to score his most popular hit with the track.
1	Kilgore had heart surgery in 2004 and was also diagnosed with lung cancer.
1	His death has been attributed to treatment he was undergoing for the cancer.
1	His first self-penned top 10 hit was Dear Mama in 1959.
1	One of the first songs he wrote for other artists was Wolverton Mountain, which sold 10 million copies when recorded by Claude King.
1	He then wrote Ring of Fire with June Carter Cash, which was about her unrequited love for Johnny, who she later married.
1	It was first recorded by her younger sister Anita Carter before Johnny went on to make such a success of it.
1	June Carter Cash previously said it upset her husband when Kilgore talked about the song without crediting her and believed he should not have been credited on it.
1	Last year, Kilgore turned up an awards dinner in a wheelchair expecting to honour Hank Williams Jr, but instead he was the surprise recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the International Entertainment Buyers Association.
1	My memories of Marley...  To mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star Bob Marley, Rob Partridge - Marleys former head of press at Island Records - remembers the man behind the legend.
1	Partridge worked with Marley from 1977 until the Jamaican musicians death in 1981.
1	: I joined Island Records in 1977 and the first week I was there I worked on his show at the Rainbow Theatre.
1	It was one of the last dates he did in London. : The album Exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status.
1	By 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world.
1	I remember going to see dates in Milan and Turin and they were enormous concerts. : Bob was one of the most mesmeric people Ive ever had the privilege to work with.
1	He must have had an iron will to succeed.
1	Bob was a very driven individual.
1	You realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in.
1	He didnt suffer fools gladly.
1	At the risk of stating the obvious, he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest Ive ever seen.
1	I saw him many times. : I recall in 1978 he came to the UK for Top of the Pops and a Daily Mirror journalist did a half-hour interview.
1	It was interrupted to do a rehearsal.
1	He came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a World Cup match on TV.
1	He sat down in front of the TV and after 10 minutes it was obvious he wasnt going to move.
1	That was the end of it.
1	The Mirror had a very truncated interview.
1	The last time I saw him was in London in 1980.
1	I arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in Fulham.
1	Bob was a good player.
1	We are talking about Jamaican-style football.
1	He was an attacking midfield player.
1	His team assembled wherever his gigs were.
1	We played in Brazil against some World Cup-winning players. : It was always a struggle for him to connect with Black America.
1	Reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s.
1	But Bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in America and the Third World.
1	In 1991, ten years after his death, he sold more records than at any time during his life.
1	We saw Black America taking Bob into their hearts for the first time. : Bob, in worldwide terms, is the greatest music star there has ever been.
1	If you went to Africa he would be recognised everywhere, in places John Lennon or Elvis wouldnt be.
1	No disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest, the best and the most influential artist in popular music. : Well 1981 was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder.
1	He had only performed in Zimbabwe and Guinea before.
1	Of course the 1981 tour never happened, but the whole of Africa would have embraced him.
1	We cant speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old.
1	I had no sense his career was going to go downhill. : Bob was endlessly optimistic about the way Africa would turn out.
1	He realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind.
1	Im sure if he were alive today he would believe Africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the Aids epidemic. : The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song - one of the most incredible classics of all time. Belle named best Scottish band Belle & Sebastian have been named the best Scottish band of all time after a three month-long public poll.
1	The group beat Travis and Idlewild into second and third place respectively.
1	Franz Ferdinand, who recently picked up five Brit Award nominations, ended up in 15th place, while the Eurythmics wound up at a lowly 38.
1	Other Scottish acts, such as the Mull Historical Society who also featured in the top 50, performed at a party in Glasgow where the result was announced.
1	Scottish-based band Snow Patrol, who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of Brit Awards, were among the performers who covered well-known Scottish pop songs at the party on Wednesday night.
1	Indie stalwarts Belle & Sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to 1997.
1	They were the surprise winners of the Brit Award for best breakthrough act two years later.
1	Scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list, including 1970s tartan boy band the Bay City Rollers and goth favourites the Jesus and Mary Chain.
1	Scottish magazine The List recently compiled a list of the top 50 Scottish bands of all time, but left the final decision to the public.
1	The magazines music editor Mark Robertson said: The idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of Scottish music, from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop, right up to todays international stars. Everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide, he added.
1	BBC Radio Scotland presenter Vic Galloway, who has been involved in the project, said it had been great fun to look back at Scotlands musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming Scottish acts.
1	Dance music not dead says Fatboy DJ Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - has said that dance music is not dead, but has admitted it is currently going through a fallow patch.
1	The commercial failure of the latest albums by Britains two biggest dance acts - Fatboy Slims Palookaville and The Prodigys Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs, and the folding of three dance music magazines.
1	Last month the Brit Awards announced they would no longer be awarding a Best Dance Act prize, with the Brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where its happening in music. These developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre.
1	Cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, Halfway Between The Gutter And The Stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over.
1	Every week when I was making the album, I was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat, he told BBC World Services The Ticket programme.
1	I personally dont believe its either dead or going to die, but its going through a bit of a fallow patch.
1	So I think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead I would think right, scrub that track then. Although his album sales in the UK are down - Palookaville stayed in the UK top 75 for just three weeks - Cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties.
1	And event on Brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in Rio achieved a crowd of 360,000.
1	The DVD of the Rio set was the biggest seller of that year.
1	With a crowd that big, if the weathers nice, the atmosphere before I even go is so good that about halfway through the first record I think Ive got them, Cook said.
1	Im always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me Valium before Rio, because two hours before I was literally just pacing the floor.
1	For some reason, especially now Ive got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre thats already going on means all I have to do is play up records. He promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the Brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt.
1	One man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party.
1	Were having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because theres landlocked countries that want to get involved, Cook said.
1	Were doing Rio at the carnival, at the Maracana, and Sao Paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums. The DJ admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life.
1	In particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to Radio One presenter Zoe Ball, after she was linked with DJ Dan Peppe.
1	The tabloid thing has been difficult at times, Cook said.
1	Especially the me-and-Zoe-Gate - its quite scary. He said that he had been determined that what had happened with Ball did not affect the album.
1	At first I was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldnt think I was depressed, he explained.
1	Then I thought, thats not right. And he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended.
1	I said to Zoe, I did this track called My Masochistic Baby Went And Left Me, do you mind if its on the album? he recalled.
1	She said, yeah, its hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you. Cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where Paul McCartney is a neighbour.
1	Its almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs, Cook explained.
1	If theres a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each others doors - Paul comes round, and we warn him, because we dont know who theyre after. Label withdraws McFaddens video The new video of former Westlife singer Brian McFadden has been pulled after a Dublin school complained about being associated with his song Irish Son.
1	St Fintians High School says it is clearly identified in the video, while McFadden never went there.
1	McFadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the songs lyrics, saying it had cell blocks.
1	The performers record label Sony BMG has withdrawn the video and issued replacements to television stations.
1	The label believed the school name was fictitious until they received the complaint.
1	They have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental.
1	The head of Christian Brothers school St Fintians, Richard Fogarty, said the video implied that the 24-year-old pop star had attended his school and was abused there.
1	The school has always treated its pupils with respect, Mr Fogarty said in a statement.
1	McFadden makes specific references to the Christian Brothers in his song, but did not attend St Fintians.
1	Corporal punishment was outlawed in Irish schools in 1982 when McFadden was two years old.
1	McFadden, whose debut solo album is released next week, has said that every song is autobiographical and a true story.
1	Alcoholism and domestic violence are among the other topics dealt with in his songs, half of which have been written with Robbie Williams former collaborator, Guy Chambers.
1	McFadden, who quit chart-topping group Westlife in March, went to number one in September with his first solo single Real To Me.
1	He enjoyed 12 chart-toppers with the boy band before parting company with them.
1	Byrds producer Melcher dies at 62 Record producer Terry Melcher, who was behind hits by the Byrds, Ry Cooder and the Beach Boys, has died aged 62.
1	The son of actress Doris Day, he helped write Kokomo for the Beach Boys, which was used in the movie Cocktail, earning a 1988 Golden Globe nomination.
1	He also produced Mr Tambourine Man for the Byrds, as well as other his such as Turn, Turn Turn.
1	Melcher died on Friday night at his home in Beverly Hills, California, after a long battle with skin cancer.
1	He joined Columbia Records as a producer in the mid-1960s, and also worked with Gram Parsons and the Mamas and the Papas.
1	Earlier in his career, Melcher had hits as part of duo called Bruce & Terry, with future Beach Boy Bruce Johnston, which evolved into the Rip Chords group.
1	Melcher also worked closely with his mother, producing The Doris Day Show and helping to run her charitable activities.
1	In 1969 his name became linked with the Charles Manson murders, which saw the deaths of actress Sharon Tate and four of her friends at a home which Melcher once rented.
1	Rumours circulated that Melcher - who knew Manson - was the killers real target, because he had turned him down for a record contract.
1	But Los Angeles police discounted the rumours, pointing out Melcher had moved to Malibu, and Manson knew of his new address.
1	Snow Patrol feted at Irish awards Snow Patrol were the big winners in Irelands top music honours, the Meteor Awards, picking up accolades for best Irish band and album on Thursday.
1	The Belfast-born, Glasgow-based band collected the prizes at the ceremony at Dublins Point Theatre.
1	Westlife won the award for best Irish pop act, voted for by the public, beating former member Brian McFadden.
1	Franz Ferdinand picked up best international band and album while Paddy Casey collected best Irish male.

1	Juliette Turner was named best Irish female.
1	In the international categories, Morrissey beat Eminem, Usher and Robbie Williams to best male while PJ Harvey pipped Kylie Minogue, Joss Stone, Anastacia and Natasha Bedingfield to the female crown.
1	The 8,000 fans at the ceremony were treated to performances from US rapper Snoop Dogg, Brian McFadden with Delta Goodrem and The Thrills featuring Rolling Stones star Ronnie Wood.
1	Snow Patrols success came after a year in which they made a chart breakthrough with their third album Final Straw.
1	I think a lot of bands should go through a wee bit of a kicking before the make a success, singer Gary Lightbody and drummer Jonny Quinn said.
1	It has been good for us, but also hard for us over the past six years. Snow Patrol will support U2 on their European tour later this year - but U2 were not nominated for best Irish band and album.
1	Doves soar to UK album summit Manchester rock band Doves have entered the UK album chart at number one with their new release, Some Cities.
1	The trio replace flamboyant US act Scissor Sisters at the top.

1	Downloads enter US singles chart Digital music downloads are being included in the main US singles chart for the first time.
1	Billboards Hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart.
1	Green Days Boulevard of Broken Dreams is currently number two in Billboards pop chart, and tops its digital chart.
1	Download sales are due to be incorporated into the UK singles chart later this year.
1	Digital sales in the US are already used to compile Billboards Hot Digital Sales chart.
1	They will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new Hot 100 chart.
1	Its second new chart - the Pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to US radio stations which play chart music.
1	In addition to Green Day, other artists in the current US digital sales top 10 include Kelly Clarkson, The Game and the Killers.
1	Sales of legally downloaded songs shot up more than tenfold in 2004, with 200 million track purchased online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported last month.
1	In the UK sales of song downloads overtook those for physical singles for the first time at the end of last year.
1	The last week of December 2004 saw download sales of 312,000 compared with 282,000 physical singles, according to the British Phonographic Industry.
1	The UKs first official music download chart was launched last September, compiling the most popular tracks downloaded from legal UK sites - including iTunes, OD2, mycokemusic.
1	com and Napster.
1	Westlifes Flying Without Wings - a 1999 track reissued for the occasion - was the first number one of the UK download chart.
1	A spokesman for the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) said the first combined UK download and sales chart was due to be compiled within the first half of this year.
1	Work is going on across the music business right now to make sure the new chart works to plan, he said.
1	The BPI spokesman described the UK music download chart, compiled by the Official Charts Company, as having been a great success since its launch.
1	It has provided a focus for the industry and has really driven interest in downloads among music fans, he said.
1	Top gig award for Scissor Sisters New York band Scissor Sisters have won a gig of the year award for their performance at this years V Festival.
1	The award was voted for by listeners of Virgin Radio, which compiled a top 10 which was mostly dominated by newcomers on the music scene this year.
1	The quirky disco-rock band beat The Red Hot Chili Peppers who came second for their Hyde Park performance in June.
1	Virgin Radio DJ Pete Mitchell said: This year has seen an amazing array of talent come into the mainstream. He added: The Scissor Sisters are one of the most original, eccentric bands to come through and its no surprise the British public are lapping up their performances. Newcomers Keane came in third place for their August gig at the V Festival, followed by Maroon 5 and Snow Patrol.
1	Music veterans The Who and David Bowie, both earned places on the list, at number eight and 10 respectively.

1	Charity single for quake relief Singers including Sir Cliff Richard and Boy George are recording a charity single to help raise funds for victims of the Asian tsunami.
1	They hope the song will raise more than £2m for the relief fund.
1	The song, titled Grief Never Grows Old and described as a melancholy ballad, was written by radio DJ Mike Read.
1	Former Boyzone singer Ronan Keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in Switzerland.
1	Other music stars being approached include Robin and Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, jazz sensation Jamie Cullum, Chris Rea and Olivia Newton-John.
1	Sir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York.
1	Read wrote the song before the Boxing Day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release.
1	Now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name One World Project.
1	Its a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, its such a good song, but its such a sad song, Read said.
1	He said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a sing-along like the Band Aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in Africa.
1	The backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible.
1	Read went to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which is co-ordinating the British relief effort, with the idea the day after Boxing Day.
1	I was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents, he said.
1	Read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the DEC.
1	Id only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one, he added.
1	The charity welcomed the news of the single and said money raised would help its agencies working in the affected region to rebuild survivors lives and livelihoods.
1	Franz man seeks government help Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.
1	For any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well, he said.
1	But Kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with MPs, at the University of Edinburgh event.
1	I think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them, he said.
1	Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotlands role in making 21st Century music.
1	There are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent self-sufficient, he said.
1	But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well. He warned musicians against being allied to a particular party, however.
1	I dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea. Kapranos and his Glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks Brit Awards, including best group and best album.
1	Their self-titled debut album won last years Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top 20 singles.
1	He told the 300-strong audience at the Universitys Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes.
1	We say I like this.
1	Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual, Im riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy, I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because Im upbeat and I like to party, I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning. Kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music, adding: There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM. He concluded: We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity. Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed: We need to rediscover our ability to listen. Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking.
1	Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming Brits performance.
1	I dont really care about the Brits, he said.
1	Its going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight. I think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues.
1	Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.
1	Rather than expecting the government - i.
1	e.
1	the taxpayer - to fork out, why dont some of the megastars put something back in? Some of Britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc.
1	There are far more important demands on government funds.
1	If they can fund football, why not fund music? Areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music.
1	The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.
1	The government has enough problems funding schools and health services.
1	If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.
1	As a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods! I think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? The answer is most definitely no.
1	Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies.
1	I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.
1	Yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.
1	There are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the new deal.
1	Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.
1	As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move.
1	I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.
1	Only if the proposals make financial sense.
1	Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out.
1	However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician.
1	The government shouldnt fund music - it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.
1	I think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise.
1	The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people.
1	However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.
1	I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal.
1	Yeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff.
1	Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer.
1	There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy.
1	Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers.
1	Call it a tax on music pollution, if you like.
1	Though I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos.
1	Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues.
1	Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting.
1	The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US.
1	Hard act to follow for OutKast US rap duo OutKasts trio of trophies at the MTV Europe Awards crowns a year of huge success for the band.
1	The latest triumph adds to the three Grammys and four American MTV gongs won earlier in this year.
1	Andre 3000 and Big Bois album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world.
1	The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya! It took another track from the exponents of southern hip-hop - The Way You Move - to displace it from the top spot.
1	The Georgia pairs year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow - what can be next for a musical act that has done it all? G Money, a presenter on the BBCs urban music station 1Xtra, thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure - giving the band time to think about other interests.
1	They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects.
1	Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business, says the DJ.
1	But in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double CD.
1	Their greatness has become clear with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.
1	We havent seen the last of them, he adds.
1	OutKasts musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past, with their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum.
1	But it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the UK with Ms Jackson, while their album Stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the US.
1	1Xtras G Money says it took the latest album, released in 2003, for him to be assured of their genius.
1	They have always been experimental, some of it has worked and some hasnt, he adds.
1	But G Money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough.
1	What can you do next when youve done it all? he says.
1	With ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame, it seems that OutKast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry.
1	Sir Paul rocks Super Bowl crowds Sir Paul McCartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at American footballs Super Bowl - and avoided any Janet Jackson-style controversies.
1	The 62-year-old sang Hey Jude and other Beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in Florida.
1	Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine.
1	Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang.
1	Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.
1	Three years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom.
1	This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back.
1	He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings.
1	Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude.
1	The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jacksons headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot.
1	The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second Nipple-gate were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.
1	Earlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the nights other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show.
1	Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs.
1	After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this years half-time show.
1	His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies.
1	The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event.
1	Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.
1	Rock group Korns guitarist quits The guitarist with US rock band Korn has quit the music business, saying he made the decision after experiencing a religious awakening.
1	Brian Head Welch told a radio station in California that his bandmates respected his decision to leave.
1	A replacement guitarist has yet to be named by Korn, who are currently at work on their eighth studio album.
1	Welch added that he would appear at a church in Bakersfield to explain how he got to this place in life.
1	The remaining members of Korn, who are known for their hardcore brand of rock, said they hoped Welch finds the happiness he is looking for.
1	The 34-year-old made reference to the bands aggressive brand of music and its young fans in his parting statement.
1	Anger is a good thing, and if kids want to listen to Korn, good, but theres happiness after the anger, he told his local radio station in Bakersfield.
1	Im going to show it through my actions, how much I love my fans, added Welch.
1	Korn have enjoyed a moderate degree of chart success in the UK, with 10 singles breaking into the Top 40.
1	Their best performance to date in the UK has been 2002s Here To Stay, which reached number 12, while their album Untouchables, released in the same year, made it to number four.
1	Vibe awards back despite violence The US Vibe awards will be held again next year despite a stabbing which happened during the ceremony.
1	Vibe magazine president Kenard Gibbs said the attack earlier this month in Santa Monica was sickening.
1	He said not holding the awards would be counter to the work the magazine has done to promote hip hop music.
1	Rapper Young Buck has been charged after allegedly stabbing a man who hit Dr Dre as he was about to receive a lifetime achievement award.
1	The rapper, whose real name is David Darnell Brown, is due in court on 20 December after being arrested on one charge of attempted murder and a second charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
1	The performer is one of the members of 50 Cents G-Unit group, which is signed to Dr Dres record label.
1	The man who was stabbed, Jimmy James Johnson, suffered a collapsed lung and is in a stable condition at a Los Angeles hospital.
1	Mr Johnson allegedly approached Dr Dre, who was seated at a table in front of the stage, and appeared to ask for an autograph before punching him.
1	During the ensuing scuffle - which involved many of the 1,000-strong crowd - Mr Johnson was stabbed as he was being dragged away by security staff, Christmas song formula unveiled A formula for the ultimate Christmas single has been revealed by chart bible British Hit Singles and Albums.
1	The recipe includes a reference to Father Christmas, sleigh bells, a childrens choir and a charity element.
1	The song should also include Christmas in the title, wishes for peace on earth and lots of airplay at office parties.
1	There are common musical elements linking nearly all the big Christmas number ones of recent times, said editor David Roberts.
1	The books analysts commissioned chart prank group Moped to create the first Christmas single using the whole formula - the song is called Gonna Have a No 1 This Christmas by Moped Vs Santa.
1	Everybody says that Christmas number ones are formulaic, but Gonna Have a Number One this Christmas is the first song to crack the formula and combine all these elements into one ultimate Christmas track said Mr Roberts.
1	Surprisingly, theres no Santa listed among the 8,000, top 75 chart performers in the book, so this is our chance to help Santa to his rightful place in British recording history. Big festive hits over the years include Band Aids Do They Know Its Christmas?, Slades Merry Christmas Everybody, Whams Last Christmas and Sir Cliff Richards Mistletoe and Wine.
1	Band Aid 20s remake of Do They Know Its Christmas is set to be confirmed as number one in the charts on Sunday.
1	Glastonbury fans to get ID cards Fans who buy tickets for this years Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed.
1	The cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged.
1	Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April.
1	There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets, festival organiser Michael Eavis said.
1	That will be the official source.
1	If you get them anywhere else, you wont get in. Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.
1	More than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the events rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years.
1	When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis daughter Emily said it would be quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events if implemented and they were going as far as we can to cut touting.
1	As long as its approached in the right way, it might really work, it might really change the system, she said.
1	In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours.
1	They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill.
1	But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name.
1	No details of this years line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.
1	Queen recruit singer for new tour The remaining members of rock band Queen are to go on tour next year with former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers taking Freddie Mercurys place.
1	Guitarist Brian May has said he expects to be on the road with Rodgers and drummer Roger Taylor from April.
1	May said: Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives. Queen have played with many different singers since Mercurys death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured.
1	May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.
1	We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was something happening here, May wrote on his website.
1	They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor.
1	The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together, May wrote.
1	Queen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof.
1	Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage.
1	Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful supergroup with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople.
1	He has also been in The Firm with Led Zeppelins Jimmy Page and The Law with The Small Faces and The Who drummer Kenny Jones.
1	U2 to play at Grammy awards show Irish rock band U2 are to play live at the Grammy Awards presentation in the US next month, organisers have said.
1	Other acts to play include soul singer Alicia Keys, country singer Tim McGraw and punk band Green Day at the event on 13 February in Los Angeles.
1	U2 are nominated twice for their recent single Vertigo, including a nomination for best rock song.
1	This year the Grammys have been dominated by rap star Kanye West, who is in contention for 10 awards.
1	US comedian Ellen Degeneres and singer Christine Milian will present awards at the event.
1	Last week Grammy producers announced the show will be hosted by rap star and Chicago actress Queen Latifah.
1	It will be held at the Staples Center.
1	U2 had number one success in the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic in November when their latest studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, topped the US and UK charts.
1	The band, who are also dominated for best international album at this years Brit Awards, are to undertake a major world tour this year, their first for four years.
1	Rock band U2 break ticket record U2 have smashed Irish box office records with ticket sales for their Dublin concerts, after more than 150,000 were sold within 50 minutes.
1	Tickets for the two concerts at the citys Croke Park stadium were released at 8am on Friday morning.
1	Nothing like it has ever been seen in Ireland before, said Justin Green, spokesman for organisers MCD Promoters.
1	We could have sold a million tickets. The Dublin dates on June 24 and 25 form part of the worldwide Vertigo tour.
1	The tour begins in San Diego on 28 March and will cover 13 US cities.
1	The band will also play 24 European gigs, finishing in Lisbon in August.
1	Mr Green said that ticket outlets had been bombarded by U2 fans.
1	Unfortunately theres thousands and thousands of disappointed fans all over the country which is disappointing, but theres only two dates confirmed, he said.
1	Many fans camped on the streets of the Irish capital for three days to ensure they were first in line at Ticketmaster in St Stephens Green Shopping Centre, where the tickets went on sale on Friday.
1	However the majority of tickets, priced at between 59.50 and 80 euro each, were sold online.
1	Earlier this week, Bono announced that the band would play two shows at the venue, which holds almost 80,000 people, due to the phenomenal demand for tickets.
1	Police praise courageous Ozzy Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has been praised by police for very courageously tackling a burglar who stole jewellery from his house.
1	The singer grabbed an intruder who then jumped 30ft (10m) from a first floor window as the star gave chase at his Buckinghamshire home on Monday.
1	I acted on impulse, Osbourne said.
1	In hindsight, it could have been a lot worse.
1	It couldve got really ugly. A £100,000 reward has been offered for information leading to a conviction.
1	His wife Sharon, who called the police, said her wedding rings were taken from her bedside table as she slept.
1	The heavy metal star said he could have met the same fate as late Beatle George Harrison, who was repeatedly stabbed in a break-in in 1999.
1	I could have been badly injured or shot or anything, Osbourne said.
1	I just thank God that no-one got injured. He added he was glad the intruders were not hurt.
1	I wouldnt want anyone to get injured. The singer did not want to talk in detail about his actions but when asked whether he would do the same again replied: Is the Pope a Catholic? The incident happened at 0400 GMT on Monday in Chalfont St Peter.
1	Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window.
1	Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house, he said.
1	Ozzy said he was just coming to grips with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US.
1	We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and Im very disappointed. At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items.
1	They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago.
1	She said she wished she had worn them at night.
1	I always take them off and put them beside my bed and thats where they were, right beside me on my bedside table. Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure.
1	A daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen.
1	She expressed her anger at the person who hasnt worked and wants to take whats yours.
1	But the thing is, we worked for everything.
1	I came from Brixton.
1	Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything weve got we have worked our arses off for. If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, thats my business and I worked for every God damn penny. Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wifes colon cancer, their childrens drug problems and now the burglary.
1	On Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton Johns partner David Furnish.
1	Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5 10 tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers.
1	They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window.
1	There is no description of his accomplice.
1	Police think the pair were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at speed.
1	Police appealed for public help to find the perpetrators and stolen items on 0845 8 505 505 or 0800 555 111.
1	New York rockers top talent poll New York electro-rock group The Bravery have come top of the BBC News websites Sound of 2005 poll to find the music scenes most promising new act.
1	The Bravery, who have been compared to The Cure and New Order, were the most heavily-tipped act in the survey of 110 impartial critics and broadcasters.
1	Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003.
1	Other new artists in this years list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third.
1	The Bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported bands including The Libertines, Interpol and Echo and the Bunnymen.
1	They were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single, Unconditional, caused a huge buzz when it was released in the UK in November.
1	Singer Sam Endicott said he felt great about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list.
1	Anyone that says they dont want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass, a liar, he said.
1	One of the experts to tip The Bravery was The Times music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were spiky but in love with pop.
1	Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Musics chart show, said the band had great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound.
1	The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent, he said.
1	Nigel Harding, head of music at London rock radio station Xfm, said every track from their live set sounded like a potential single.
1	Unconditional reached the summit of the stations listeners chart within a fortnight of its first play, which Mr Harding described as an unheard of achievement for a debut single.
1	Q magazine reviews editor Ted Kessler said they were pretty-boy New York clothes horses with an unusually nimble ear for concise, yearning pop in the mould of Duran Duran or The Strokes.
1	Other pundits to take part in the survey included BBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, NME editor Conor McNicholas, Top of the Pops presenter Fearne Cotton, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis and BBC Radio 2 music editor Colin Martin.

1	Boy band McFly were sixth while Scissor Sisters, who had the UKs best-selling album of 2004, were seventh.
1	In the survey, the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in terms of sales or critical acclaim.
1	The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor.
1	Those tips were then counted and compiled to make the top 10.
1	Blair buys copies of new Band Aid Prime Minister Tony Blair purchased two copies of the charity single Band Aid 20 in Edinburgh on Friday.
1	Staff were surprised when the Prime Minister walked into HMV at 0900 GMT, accompanied by aides and local police.
1	When Mr Blair came in unannounced, we were all pretty gobsmacked, said HMV manager Clive Smith.
1	Our customer helper approached him... it was only then we realised he wanted to buy copies of the Band Aid single, rather than the latest Eminem album. Predicted chart-topper Do They Know its Christmas? is expected to sell at least 300,000 copies by the time the new chart is announced on Sunday.

1	Anthony became Lopezs third husband in June 2004.
1	He won a Grammy in 1998 and is nominated for two more this year.
1	The 13 February ceremony will also include a rendition of The Beatles Across The Universe by Bono, Stevie Wonder, Norah Jones and Brian Wilson.
1	The song will go on sale online to raise money for the tsunami aid effort.
1	The awards show will also feature performances from U2, Green Day, Alicia Keys and Kanye West - but the Lopez and Anthony duet is likely to be one of the biggest talking points.

1	Alicia Keys and Usher share eight nominations each.
1	Beastie Boys win sampling battle US rappers Beastie Boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song Pass the Mic.
1	The punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist James Newtons Choir in their track from 1992.
1	Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed.
1	But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition.
1	The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.
1	Sampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song.
1	A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newtons recording.
1	That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys.
1	We hold that Beastie Boys use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newtons copyright, Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion.
1	Mr Newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist, composer, performer, and university professor.
1	Mr Newton and the Beastie Boys were not available for comment.
1	Pupils to get anti-piracy lessons Lessons on music piracy and copyright issues are to be taught to secondary school pupils in the UK.
1	The lessons, aimed at 11 to 14-year-olds, will introduce them to copyright - including the issues of downloading from the internet and the illegal copying of CDs - and its role in protecting creativity.
1	Music piracy, including illegally swapping music online, costs the UK music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world-wide CD sales.
1	British Music Rights (BMR) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.
1	Songwriter Guy Chambers, who has worked with stars including Robbie Williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme.
1	He said as well as educating children about music piracy, it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from unscrupulous individuals.
1	At a debate in London to launch the scheme, Chambers said: I think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools.
1	These lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers. The education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry.
1	It will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.
1	Henri Yoxall, general manager of British Music Rights, told BBC News schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues.
1	The scheme - which is an extension of BMRs Respect the Value of Music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters Feargal Sharkey, Lucie Silvas and Grammy Award-winning composer David Arnold.
1	Silvas said: I think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age.
1	I wish I had been given an opportunity like this when I was at school. Emma Pike, director general of British Music Rights, said: We believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools.
1	It is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value.
1	Copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change.
1	Technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways. Spector facing more legal action Music producer Phil Spector is facing legal action from the mother of the actress he has been accused of killing.
1	Donna Clarkson, whose daughter Lana was found dead in Mr Spectors home in February 2003, is seeking unspecified damages in a civil action.
1	The legal action accuses Mr Spector of murdering the actress at his LA home.
1	Mr Spector is currently free on $1m (£535,000) bail and is awaiting trial.
1	The 64-year-old has denied the killing, saying her death was accidental.
1	Ms Clarksons legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also accuses Mr Spector of negligence and battery, alleging he grabbed, hit, fought with and restrained Lana Clarkson before shooting her to death.
1	Her lawyers said in a statement: The Clarkson family had hoped that there would be some resolution with regard to the criminal proceedings before moving forward with the civil action.
1	However, Ms Clarkson and her family understand that the fair administration of justice takes time and in light of the numerous changes Mr Spector has made in his legal defence team over the last two years, Ms Clarkson was forced to file the action before (the statute of limitations expired) on 3 February 2005. Mr Spector, known for his work with the Beatles, has claimed that Lana Clarkson committed suicide.
1	His lawyers, led by Bruce Cutler, have vowed to prove him innocent at trial.
1	Mr Cutler said: Phil did not cause the death of this woman, hes not criminally responsible and hes not civilly responsible either.
1	But Im not surprised they filed a suit for money, that seems to be de rigueur nowadays. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge is expected to set a trial date later this month for Spector, who was indicted on murder charges in September.
1	Roderick Lindblom, one of Ms Clarksons lawyers, said: Our intent is to let the criminal proceedings go forward and not do anything that would interfere with the prosecution. Usher leads Billboard nominations R&B singer Usher is leading the race for the Billboard awards with nominations in 13 categories, including best male.
1	Alicia Keys has 12 nominations for the awards, which will be held on 8 December at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
1	Other multiple nominees include Maroon5, OutKast, Kanye West, R Kelly, Gretchen Wilson, Hoobastank and Jay-Z.
1	Soul singer Stevie Wonder will receive Billboards Century Award, the magazines highest honour for creative achievement, at the ceremony.
1	The awards will be hosted by American Idol presenter Ryan Seacrest, and will feature performances by Usher, Gwen Stefani, Nelly and Green Day.
1	Usher and Keys will be battling it out for prizes including artist of the year, Hot 100 songwriter of the year and Billboard 200 album of the year for their respective albums Confessions and The Diary of Alicia Keys.
1	Maroon5 and OutKast are also up for artist of the year, while OutKasts Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is a finalist for Billboard 200 album of the year, alongside Josh Grobans Closer.
1	The awards honour the years leading artists and songs as determined by their performance on Billboards weekly charts.
1	Eminem secret gig venue revealed Rapper Eminem is to play an intimate gig in London on Saturday, following a show on the River Thames on Friday.
1	The US star will play just two songs at a night showcasing his label Shady Records at the Islington Academy.
1	Eminem performed on HMS Belfast on Friday, which is docked on the River Thames, where he filmed two songs for BBC Ones Top of the Pops.
1	He arrived in the UK on Friday following his appearance at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.
1	Other rap acts who may appear at the Islington gig include Stat Quo, Proof, DJ Green Lantern, Swift and Obie Trice.
1	Eminems latest album soared to the top of the US chart after just three days on sale in record shops.
1	Encore is now a chart-topper on both sides of the Atlantic following its debut at number one in the UK.
1	The fourth album from the rap star was on sale for two days before it outsold all of its rivals.
1	The album was released early in an effort to combat both physical and online piracy.
1	Eminems album includes the track Mosh, which is a tirade against US President Bush and the presence of US troops in Iraq.
1	The rapper was criticised earlier this year after a performance on BBC Ones Top of the Pops in April led 12 viewers to complain he was lewd and offensive.
1	The complaints about the star grabbing his crotch were upheld by the BBC.
1	The performer had been asked to tone his act down after rehearsal but ignored this request during the live broadcast, a BBC statement read.
1	Although his gestures were part of the rap culture, they had gone beyond what is expected. Beatles suits sell for $110,000 Four suits worn by the Beatles on their Please Please Me album cover have sold for $110,00 (£59,000) at a US auction.
1	But some of Elvis Presleys earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - failed to sell at the Bonhams and Butterfields two-day sale.
1	A private collection of six tape recordings of Presley valued at between $30,000 (£16,000) and $50,000 (£27,000) did not meet their reserve price.
1	A signed Presley photograph managed to fetch $2,115 (£1,140).
1	Auction spokesman Erik Simon said the Presley tapes were withdrawn because they did not meet the minimum price set by the owners.
1	He said the family of sound engineer Thorne Nogar did not want to divulge the price they had set or the offers they had received.
1	The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957.
1	The pre-masters include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and Mr Nogar.
1	Weve had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them.
1	And frankly, we could use the money, Mr Nogars son Stephen, 57, said before the auction.
1	Mr Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs.
1	He called them his ass-saver tapes, his son said.
1	The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record.
1	Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes could only be sold for personal enjoyment and cannot be copied for commercial gain.
1	The auction made a total of $1.1m (£600,000).
1	OutKast win at MTV Europe Awards US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.
1	They won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations.
1	R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists.
1	OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February.
1	Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music.
1	Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.
1	Andre 3000 thanked fans for supporting OutKast throughout the years.
1	We really appreciate it, he said.
1	I hope you dont get tired of us, but we only do what we do. Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5.
1	And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.
1	OutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite.
1	Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown.
1	He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.
1	Eminems group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly.
1	Eminem told the crowd: D12 finally won an award, thank you very much. The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children.
1	The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears.
1	Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award means so much to me.
1	Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.
1	Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as quite an honour while Muse said their win for best alternative act was a real surprise for us.
1	Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets.
1	Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: There needs to be more European bands. The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world.
1	The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams.
1	MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capitals ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000.
1	Last years big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.
1	Oasis star fined for German brawl Oasis singer Liam Gallagher has been fined 50,000 euros (£35,000) after a fight in a German hotel two years ago.
1	Gallagher was arrested along with drummer Alan White and three other members of the bands entourage after the brawl in Munich in December 2002.
1	The band said they were victims of an unprovoked attack in a nightclub.
1	But police said Gallagher kicked an officer in the chest and had large amounts of alcohol and drugs - possibly cocaine - in his blood.
1	Gallagher lost two front teeth in the fight, which led to the band abandoning their German tour.
1	His brother and bandmate Noel was in bed at the time.
1	The process has stopped by paying 50,000 euros, said Anton Winkler, spokesman for the Munich prosecutor.
1	At the time, police said a physical altercation broke out among the musicians at about 0200 local time.
1	That led to one of the group being jostled and falling onto the table of five Italian guests - causing the fight, they said.
1	The fight continued outside, where one of the officers was kicked in the chest with full force by Liam Gallagher... and suffered minor injuries, they said.

1	It was blocked by Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who did not want unreleased song You Know Youre Right on the box set.
1	The dispute between Love and surviving band members Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl was settled in 2002.
1	Work began on the box set in 1998, but legal battles put the project on hold.
1	The legal fight centred on a studio recording of the unreleased track You Know Youre Right, regarded by fans as one of the unreleased gems of Nirvana.
1	The set, released on Tuesday, features three CDs and a DVD of rare performance and rehearsal footage.
1	The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991.

1	The bands development ended tragically when songwriter Kurt Cobain committed suicide in April 1994.

1	Guitarist Brian May has said he expects to be on the road with Rodgers and drummer Roger Taylor from April.
1	May said: Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives. Queen have played with many different singers since Mercurys death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured.
1	May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.
1	We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was something happening here, May wrote on his website.
1	They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor.
1	The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together, May wrote.
1	Queen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof.
1	Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage.
1	Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful supergroup with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople.

1	Band Aid 20 single storms to No 1 The new version of the Band Aid song Do They Know Its Christmas? has gone straight in at number one in the UK singles chart.
1	The charity record is also tipped to be this years Christmas number one.
1	It features vocals from the likes of Chris Martin, Dido, Robbie Williams and the Sugababes.

1	It was released in the US, and reached number 13 in the singles chart.
1	However, Band Aid 20 is not going to be released in the US, despite being sold in many countries around the world.
1	US record shops are stocking an import version of Do They Know Its Christmas, which is said to be selling very well in Los Angeles and New York.
1	British stars who appear on the current recording, such as Dido and Coldplays Chris Martin, are well known to music fans across the Atlantic, along with U2 frontman Bono.
1	Record company Universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across Europe, Asia, South America and Canada.
1	But music fans in the US are still able to access the song and download it on Band Aid 20s official website.
1	In 1985, a group of high-profile American stars known as USA For Africa came together to record their own fund-raising single, We Are The World.
1	The song was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, with Quincy Jones as producer.
1	It topped the US charts for three weeks and went on win Grammy awards for best record and song.
1	Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Tina Turner were among the line-up of performers.
1	Proceeds from the sales of the Band Aid 20 single will go towards aid relief in Africa, in countries such as Ethiopia and Sudan.
1	The money raised will also be used to help combat HIV and Aids across the continent.
1	The Band Aid Trust which was set up 20 years ago, when the original single was released, handed out $144m (£75m) to famine relief projects across Africa between January 1985 and November 2004.
1	iTunes now selling Band Aid song Ipod owners can now download the Band Aid single from iTunes after Apple reached agreement with the charity.
1	Apple had been unwilling to raise the cost of the single in line with other download services, said Band Aid.
1	But the single is now on sale for 79p - the usual cost of a song from iTunes - with Apple donating a further 70p to the charity for each song downloaded.
1	A copy of the original 1984 song is also available for download at 79p - with all proceeds going to the charity.
1	More than 72,000 copies of the new Band Aid single were sold on its first day of release on Monday, according to sales figures.
1	The track has become the fastest-selling single of the year so far, shifting more copies than the rest of the top 30 combined, HMV claimed.
1	Dido, Robbie Williams and Chris Martin are among those featured on the new version of Do They Know Its Christmas?, which is raising money to fight hunger in Africa.

1	Court halts Mark Morrison album Premiership footballer and record company boss Kevin Campbell has gained a court injunction stopping R&B singer Mark Morrison from releasing an album.
1	The Everton striker signed Morrison to his fledging 2 Wikid Records label and claims he spent thousands of pounds producing his album Innocent Man.
1	Now he is attempting to prevent Morrison releasing the album on Monday through another label.
1	But Morrison vowed to ignore the order, saying no judge is gonna stop me.
1	Morrison, who is now as well known for his brushes with the law than his music career, rose to fame with the 1996 single Return of the Mack.
1	But the Leicester singer has struggled to repeat its success following two spells in jail.
1	One was for hiring a stand-in to complete his community service for possession of a stun gun and three-months following a nightclub fracas.
1	He signed to Mr Campbells label a year ago and has released one single, with the label saying the album was due for release on 24 January.
1	But Mr Campbell said he learned that Morrison planned to release the album through Jet Star, which is advertising it on its website.
1	Mr Campbell said: Im glad we were granted the injunction but Im completely gutted that we have had to go that far.
1	Mark Morrison was given everything he asked for by 2 Wikid but it seems that he couldnt help but return to his old ways.
1	Ive worked hard to realise my ambition in football but had hoped that my future career would be in the music business.
1	I have always dreamt of starting a record label but now Mark Morrison has spoilt that dream for me.
1	There is no loyalty in this business - just greed. But Morrison is determined the album will be released on Monday.
1	He said: The injunction is ludicrous.
1	I signed a new deal with a new record company because I was not getting the support I needed from 2 Wikid.
1	I was with that label for a year and in that time released just one record, which was not properly promoted.
1	He added: The whole world is waiting for this album and it will come out on December 27.
1	No injunction or judge will stop it.
1	The Mack will return. The case is set to be heard in the High Court on 20 December.
1	Prince crowned top music earner Prince earned more than any other pop star in 2004, beating artists such Madonna and Elton John in US magazine Rolling Stones annual list.
1	The singer banked $56.5m (£30.4m) from concerts, album and publishing sales with his Musicology tour and album.
1	He kept Madonna in second place, as she earned $54.9m (£29.5m) while embarking on her global Re-Invention Tour.
1	Veterans Simon and Garfunkel were in 10th place, their comeback tour helping them earn $24.9m (£13.4m) last year.
1	Prince returned to centre stage after a decade in the commercial wilderness, the magazine reported.
1	The singers 2004 tour took $90.3m (£48.5m) in ticket sales and he sold 1.9 million copies of his latest album Musicology.
1	Although she grossed more than Prince last year, Madonna remained in second place because of the monumental production costs of her tour.
1	Heavy metal band Metallicas Madly in Anger with the World tour helped push their 2004 earnings up to $43.1m (£23.1m).
1	They were ahead of Sir Elton John, who took fourth place and almost $42.7m (£23m) from performances including a debut on the Las Vegas Strip.
1	Other seasoned performers in the list included Rod Stewart, whose sold-out shows and third volume of The Great American Songbook covers album helped net him £35m (£19m).
1	The highest-ranking rap act in the list was 50 Cent, who at number 19 took $24m (£13m) to the bank.
1	Early Elvis recordings go on sale Some of Elvis Presleys earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - are going under the hammer on Sunday at a Los Angeles auction.

1	Highlights of the two hour-long collection will get their public debut at Bonhams auction house on Saturday.
1	The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957.
1	The pre-masters include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and engineer Thorne Nogar.
1	Weve had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them, Nogars son Stephen, 57, said.
1	And frankly, we could use the money. Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs.
1	He called them his ass-saver tapes, his son said.
1	The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record.
1	Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes can only be sold for personal enjoyment and they cannot be copied for commercial gain.
1	Parkers saxophone heads auction A saxophone belonging to legendary jazz musician Charlie Parker is expected to fetch up to $1m (£535,000) at an auction of jazz memorabilia next month.

1	Comic Morris returns with sitcom Comedian Chris Morris, who created controversial TV show Brass Eye, is to return to screens with a new sitcom about a spoof London media worker.
1	Morris will direct and co-write Nathan Barley - a character from cult website TV Go Home - for Channel 4.
1	It is a send-up of the stereotypical cool metropolitan media scene, with Nicholas Burns in the title role.
1	A Brass Eye satire of the media handling of paedophilia sparked 2,500 complaints in 2001.
1	Nathan Barley will be a character-driven comedy, according to Charlie Brooker, who created TV Go Home in 1999 and has co-written the series.
1	Barley is described as a webmaster, guerrilla film-maker, screenwriter, DJ and in his own words, a self-facilitating media node.
1	The story will also feature Dan Ashcroft, a style magazine columnist, and his sister Claire, a film-maker who hates the cool scene.
1	As well as Brass Eye, Morris was behind another news show satire, The Day Today, and dark sketch comedy Jam.
1	The new show is expected to begin in February.
1	TV station refuses adoption show A TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.
1	The WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Mondays show.
1	Whos Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father.
1	It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it exploits sensitive emotions.
1	It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption, said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption.
1	It trivialises them.
1	Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this. On the pre-taped programme, the contestant is presented with eight men who may or may not be her natural father.
1	If she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590).
1	However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money.
1	Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a positive experience.
1	They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.
1	The special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast, said a Fox spokesman.
1	However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule. WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches... Personal Reflections on Adoption, a documentary about families with adopted children.
1	We just dont think adoption is a game show, said Tommy Schenck, WRAZ-TVs general manager, though he said his decision had not been influenced by public protests.
1	A-listers flock to Gervais sitcom Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.
1	He said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras.
1	They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles.
1	The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it.
1	We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct, Gervais told BBC News.
1	Its not about the zeitgeist.
1	We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part. Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line.
1	But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.
1	I didnt want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who havent even been asked.
1	I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as Im going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moores part.
1	I havent been approached and I wouldnt take it anyway. He said Stiller and Jackson would be playing twisted versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them would sail pretty close to the bone.
1	Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars.
1	Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office.
1	The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly.
1	A film will happen over the next three years but I dont want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldnt be another Spider-Man or Batman.
1	I would like to do something small on TV with it first. Campaigners attack MTV sleaze MTV has been criticised for incessant sleaze by television indecency campaigners in the US.
1	The Parents Television Council (PTC), which monitors violence and sex on TV, said the cable music channel offered the cheapest form of programming.
1	The group is at the forefront of a vociferous campaign to clean up American television.
1	But a spokeswoman for MTV said it was unfair and inaccurate to single out MTV for criticism.
1	The PTC monitored MTVs output for 171 hours from 20 March to 27 March 2004, during the channels Spring Break coverage.
1	In its report - MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs and Alcohol - the PTC said it witnessed 3,056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2,881 verbal references to sex.
1	Brent Bozell, PTC president and conservative activist said: MTV is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids.
1	Compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults, MTVs programming contains substantially more sex, foul language and violence - and MTVs shows are aimed at children as young as 12.
1	Theres no question that TV influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers, and MTV is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children. The watchdog decided to look at MTVs programmes after Janet Jacksons infamous wardrobe malfunction at last years Super Bowl.
1	The breast-baring incident generated 500,000 complaints and CBS - which is owned by the same parent company as MTV - was quick to apologise.
1	MTV spokeswoman Jeannie Kedas said the network follows the same standards as broadcasters and reflects the culture and what its viewers are interested in.
1	Its unfair and inaccurate to paint MTV with that brush of irresponsibility, she said.
1	We think its underestimating young peoples intellect and level of sophistication. Ms Kedas also highlighted the fact MTV won an award in 2004 for the Fight for Your Rights series that focused on issues such as sexual health and tolerance.
1	US actor found with gun residue Actor Robert Blake had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes the night his wife was shot dead, a court has heard.
1	But it may not have come from the shot that killed Bonny Lee Bakley in 2001, Mr Blakes murder trial was told by criminalist Steven Dowell.
1	Mr Dowell told a Los Angeles court the residue may have come from Mr Blakes revolver, his gun collection, his presence at the crime scene or police.
1	The 71-year-old former star of US TV drama Baretta has denied murder.
1	Mr Blake said he found Ms Bakley, 44, dead in a car after they left a restaurant.
1	He said he briefly returned to the restaurant to collect a gun he had left behind and discovered her body when he returned.
1	The gun he collected was not the murder weapon.
1	It could also have been picked up if he touched or leant on the car when he found the body, or from a police box in which his clothes were later stored.
1	The box had come from an area where officers went after being on the firing range.
1	But Mr Dowell also said the residue would have been present if Mr Blake fired a gun that night.
1	Witnesses have already told the trial Mr Blake stood out as being quite nervous and agitated at the restaurant before the murder.
1	The actor, who won an Emmy for playing a maverick detective in the 1970s TV cop drama Baretta, could face life in prison if convicted.
1	EastEnders is set for US remake Plans to create a US soap based on the BBCs EastEnders have reportedly been drawn up by the Fox TV network.
1	EastEnders head writer Tony Jordan and music mogul Simon Fuller are involved in the project, according to reports in the Hollywood Reporter trade newspaper.
1	It said scripts have been commissioned for a series about a community of working class people in of Chicago.
1	The original EastEnders was pulled from BBC America last year after it proved a failure in the ratings.
1	US versions of other British hits have proved less successful across the Atlantic.
1	BBC comedy Coupling was remade with a US cast, but lost its primetime slot on the NBC network due to disappointing ratings.
1	At home, EastEnders has been facing its own ratings battle, recently losing out to rival ITV soap Emmer dale.
1	Primetime soaps on US television have made a recent comeback, following the success of ABC serial Desperate Housewives.
1	The series takes a darkly comedic look at the goings-on of a group of characters living in the suburbs.
1	US to raise TV indecency fines US politicians are proposing a tough new law aimed at cracking down on indecency and bad language on US TV.
1	Fines of up to $500,000 (£266,582) could be imposed each time broadcasters transmit nudity or profanities.
1	The proposal, unveiled in the House of Representatives, also seeks to revoke a broadcasters licence after three violations have been committed.
1	The exposure of Janet Jacksons breast at last years Superbowl landed CBS with a $550,000 (£293,264) fine.
1	Entertainers could also be liable for fines under the proposed legisation from both US politcians and officials from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
1	A Republican senator from Kansas, Sam Brownbeck, is set to call for a maximum $3 million (£1.6 million) fine for repeated violations.
1	The current maximum fine stands at $32,500 (£17,320) - 20 of the stations in the CBS network were each penalised these lesser amounts for the Jackson incident.
1	Republican politician Fred Upton, who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting, said current fines are more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent.
1	Last years Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction encouraged the FCC to impose tougher rules, but the US Congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines.
1	New figures have to be decided before new legislation can be put before President Bush.
1	Certain broadcasters, like Fox, claim the material they carry does not violate indecency laws and is protected under the right to free speech.
1	Eurovision greats to do battle Stars of the Eurovision Song Contest from the shows 50-year history are to compete against each other to celebrate the contests anniversary.

1	Past Eurovision performers include Abba, Celine Dion, Bucks Fizz, Nana Mouskouri, Lulu and Julio Iglesias.
1	Fans will then vote as usual to pick the all-time best Eurovision song during the show in Denmark in October.
1	The first contest was organised by the European Broadcasting Union, or EBU, in 1956, and has become an annual event pitting pop giants against musical minnows - with often surprising results.
1	While some regard it as an essential celebration of continental talent, others see it as an equally unmissable parade of the reasons some countries do not normally produce international stars.
1	The 50th annual contest will be held in Kiev, Ukraine, in May, after Ukrainian singer Ruslana won last year.
1	The 50th anniversary special will be held in Denmark later this year because the Danish Broadcasting Corporation came up with the idea for the all-time contest.
1	A plan to hold it in London was scrapped because of problems finding a suitable venue.
1	Ireland has been the most successful country in the shows history with seven victories, followed by the UK, France and Luxembourg with five each.
1	UK TV channel rapped for CSI ad TV channel Five has been criticised for sending offensive and threatening advertising material to viewers for a new show about murder scene scientists.
1	Five mailed thousands of fake dossiers including photos of murder victims and an e-mail suggesting the recipient was being stalked by a serial killer.

1	The promotion material was sent in brown envelope of the type used by investigators in the series, a spin-off from the highly successful CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series, which also runs on Five.
1	The pack also features pictures of forensic evidence from a crime scene and a wanted poster, which did have a CSI:NY logo printed in large at the bottom.
1	Five said it had received 100 complaints but that it had been surprised at the reaction because it was obvious this material is promoting a drama.
1	A Five spokesman said: In light of the efforts we have made to make the nature of the contents so transparent we are surprised a very small minority of recipients have mistaken it as anything else.
1	Everyone who was sent this promotion has expressed an interest in receiving details about this particular genre of programming on various websites.
1	We have also received emails and calls from recipients praising the originality and imagination of the campaign. X Factor show gets second series TV talent show The X Factor is to return for a second series after being recommissioned by ITV.

1	Branson show flops on US screens Entrepreneur Sir Richard Bransons US TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, is proving a flop in the ratings.
1	The programme suffered poor viewing figures on its debut on the Fox network three weeks ago, and has lost one in five of its viewers since then.
1	The show is seen as Foxs answer to The Apprentice featuring tycoon Donald Trump, a ratings hit for rivals NBC.
1	Sir Richards show sees a group of young entrepreneurs compete to become the president of his business empire.
1	The Rebel Billionaire has averaged five million viewers and is 91st in the rankings of all prime-time shows.

1	McCririck out of Big Brother show Racing pundit John McCririck has become the latest contestant to be evicted from Celebrity Big Brother.
1	He was nominated to leave the Channel 4 show by fellow housemates, alongside Happy Mondays dancer Bez.
1	At one time Bez was among the most popular contestants but he has since become withdrawn and argumentative.
1	McCririck was ordered to leave the house on Monday, following Jackie Stallone, the actor Sylvesters mother, who was first to be evicted.
1	Bez reacted badly to the news that he had been nominated by five of his fellow housemates, whilst John received four votes against him.
1	Sylvester Stallones ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen nominated both John and Bez.
1	She said: Bez is a difficult human being.
1	Theres something wrong with him.

1	McCririck faced the public vote on Friday and received 67% of the vote to keep him in the house, whilst Jackie Stallone was evicted.
1	Chris Evans back on the market Broadcaster Chris Evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in Camden Market, London.
1	Evans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open-fronted shop packed with his furniture.
1	Among the items from his homes in Los Angeles and London were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past TV shows.
1	Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: I just want to get rid of it all, its just a headache. He added: It feels good to be selling this stuff, its a weight off my mind.
1	Look at it all, theres so much clutter.
1	Ive enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but its not important anymore. The normally gregarious Evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes, wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his Aladdins cave.
1	However, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the British public in shows such as Channel 4s gameshow Dont Forget Your Toothbrush.
1	The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size.
1	Sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four.
1	The elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom-made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered throne and a stripy deckchair from the Queen Mary liner.
1	To help people in their browsing, Evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside.
1	Isnt it great was the comment on the £1,950 throne and Bob Dylans old sofa - honest was written on a dark wood couch priced £4,250.
1	The prices were steep by a lot of peoples standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers.
1	Ive sold quite a lot already.
1	Everything here is on sale for less than I bought it for but its not really about the money.
1	Its about getting rid of it all.
1	Weve all been bartering, thats what its all about. He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making.
1	Vintage TV and film posters also lined the walls, including a rare portrait of Raquel Welch and an original advertising print from the Benny Hill Show.
1	And, almost hidden at the back of the lock-up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former Channel 4 show, although these were not for sale.
1	Despite the sheer curiosity value of the sale, there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds.
1	Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.
1	Paul Burgess said: I didnt realise.
1	I thought it was just a load of junk.
1	I should go back and have a better look. But local resident Francesca Detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of The Who by David Wedgburg.
1	Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £350 for the print.
1	If you like something, you dont really count it like that, she said.
1	Martin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans shop, said he thought it was a great idea.
1	Why not, if youve got stuff to get rid of its a good place to do it, said Mr Hellewell.
1	Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom.
1	They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there.
1	Well stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that, said Evans.

1	George Clooney recently reacted angrily to a TV hosts suggestion that not all funds raised would go towards tsunami relief.
1	Fox TVs Bill OReilly said he would be watching to see if the money gets to the tsunami victims and warned the celebrities taking part had better be involved all the way down the line.
1	But Clooney accused OReilly of creating a fuss for his own personal gain, saying viewers may now be afraid that their money will do no good.
1	He urged OReilly to co-present the TV special, adding in a letter: Were not playing games here, were trying to save lives.
1	Its as simple as this - youre either with this joint effort or against it. Organisers say all funds will go to the American Red Cross.
1	The commercial-free benefit show will also be aired by a string of cable broadcasters and Clear Channels radio stations across the US.
1	In addition, performances will be available to buy on the internet as downloads from Sonys Connect music store.

1	Top of the Pops leaves BBC One The BBCs flagship pop music programme Top of the Pops is to move from BBC One on Fridays to Sundays on BBC Two.
1	The new programme will combine with archive show TOTP2, mixing new music with footage of classic bands.
1	The corporation said the new show aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers.
1	The move is the biggest shake-up in the history of the show, which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on BBC One.
1	Top of the Pops was relaunched in a blaze of publicity in December last year in an attempt to reverse a long-term decline in audience figures.
1	The All New Top of the Pops was fronted by newcomer Tim Kash and was put together by producer Andi Peters, who was brought back to the BBC from Channel 4 to revitalise the series.
1	About three million people a week were watching the show on Fridays - less than half the total it was attracting in the mid-1990s - as the programme went up against popular ITV soap Coronation Street.
1	But despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark.
1	Tim Kash has since been replaced as host by Fearne Cotton.
1	The new show will launch in Spring next year in an extended format.
1	BBC Two controller Roly Keating: Its an exciting new era for Top of the Pops.
1	We want to make it bigger and better so that it becomes the ultimate pop music show for music lovers of every generation. Mr Keating described BBC Two as the natural home of Top of the Pops.
1	He added: The addition of Top of the Pops will also extend BBC Twos offering to younger audiences. A BBC spokeswoman said Andi Peters would continue as executive producer on the show.
1	She said that issues over the exact format of the programme and a time slot were still to be decided.
1	The programme will have a close relationship with the BBC Radio 1 chart show, which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on Sundays.
1	Hopefully the audience for Top of the Pops will find it on BBC Two.
1	We think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens. Oscar host Rock to keep it clean Oscar host Chris Rock said he will steer clear of bad language when he fronts the awards on 27 February.
1	The comedian, who recently got into trouble for poking fun at the ceremony, is renowned for his heavy use of expletives during his stand-up routine.

1	As far as content is concerned, I will talk about the movies.
1	Im not really worried about it.
1	Im sure ABC might be more worried about it than me, he added.
1	The 40-year-old comedian caused a furore when he said in an interview with US magazine Entertainment Weekly recently that he hardly ever watched the Oscars and labelled awards ceremonies idiotic.
1	The shows producers defended Rock and confirmed that he would still be presenting the Oscar ceremony, saying his comments were humorous digs.
1	Meanwhile, the Academy has announced that Oscar-nominated actress Natalie Portman will present an award at the ceremony.
1	Portman, who has been nominated for a best supporting actress gong for her role in Mike Nichols Closer, joins a growing list of stars set to bestow an award at the ceremony including Dustin Hoffman, Drew Barrymore, Renee Zellweger and British-born actress Kate Winslet.

1	Veteran comic Cyril Fletcher dies Veteran comedian and broadcaster Cyril Fletcher has died aged 91 at his home in Guernsey.
1	Fletcher will be remembered for his odd odes and amusing misprints on TV show Thats Life in the 1970s and 80s, as well as a long variety career.
1	He was also a regular on Does the Team Think?, a comic version of radio information show The Brains Trust.
1	Thats Life host Esther Rantzen said he was so lovely and a delight to work with.
1	The thing about Cyril was that he was, to use a slightly old-fashioned phrase, an English gentleman, she said.
1	He was courteous, and understated, and he adored gardens, particularly creating them for his beautiful wife.
1	He was funny and witty to work with.
1	He was a real friend and I shall miss him. One of the last comedians of old-time variety era, Fletcher made his first TV appearance in 1937.
1	A year after BBC Television began, he was seen reciting humorous poems, appearing in a revue, Tele-Ho, and playing the Emperor of Morocco in the first televised pantomime, Dick Whittington.
1	He went on to become a regular voice on radio, have a string of TV shows in the 1950s and appear in several films, including 1947s Nicholas Nickleby.
1	He married actress Betty Astell in 1941 and in the 1950s and 60s, they produced pantos and summer shows, discovering new stars including Harry Secombe.
1	In the mid-1990s, Fletcher said he had made a fabulous living since the age of 22 and had never had a day out of work.
1	He was most recently seen presenting a gardening programme for Channel TV.
1	Fletcher was described as a consummate professional by his friend and fellow broadcaster Michael Pointon.
1	It really was a pleasure to work with him - he had met everyone and done everything, Mr Pointon said.
1	He was a whimsical, droll fellow, but also a very artistic man.
1	As a friend, he was very kind, and generous. Fletchers daughter Jill said her father would be sorely missed.
1	He was greatly loved by the public, she said.

1	The BBC received 47,000 complaints before the musical was broadcast, and protesters demonstrated outside BBC buildings across the UK.
1	Springer helped launch the West End show and attended the opening night.
1	I wouldnt have written it.
1	I dont believe in making fun of other religions, he said.
1	The TV host said he understood how people could have thought the musical had gone too far.
1	You know, on our TV show if people use inappropriate language we bleep it out, if theres nudity we cover it up, so that viewers at home dont get to see any of this, he said.
1	Asked whether he thought the BBC should have screened the controversial musical he said: I dont know if they should have had it on television but, good Lord, if you dont like whats on television, thats why God gave us remote controls.
1	My show is about dysfunctional people and I defy anyone to watch the show and suggest to me the people on it arent to some degree dysfunctional. If I did a show about the war in Iraq, it wouldnt make me a warmonger, I would just be doing my job to report on the war.
1	In the case of my show, its my job to report on the dysfunctions that take place in society. The British-born presenter is in London to speak at a fundraising dinner for the United Jewish Israel Appeal.
1	The dinner, on Tuesday, is expected to be attended by more than 800 guests.
1	CSI shows give unrealistic view People have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the CSI TV shows, real experts say.
1	Evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim.
1	Lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used.
1	The issue was discussed at a major science conference in Washington DC.
1	Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) and its spin-offs, CSI: Miami and CSI: New York, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.
1	Each episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal.
1	The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show, said Max Houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University, US.
1	This TV show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof, he told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
1	The American forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged DNA samples in US labs.
1	Yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog, said Dr Houck.
1	Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the shows influence in dealing with the families of victims.
1	What I find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case, she explained.
1	For example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously.
1	But when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult. Dr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most peoples perceptions.
1	The shows influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery.
1	Prosecutors fear the CSI effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: why wasnt everything tested? Well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested, Dr Houck explained.
1	Defence attorneys also worry about the CSI effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method thats always accurate. However, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field.
1	My university course started with four graduates in 1999; were now the largest major on campus - with 400 students, he said.
1	Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: Theres more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research. Ethnic producers face barriers Minority ethnic led (Mel) production companies face barriers in succeeding in the film and television industries, research has suggested.
1	The study, commissioned by Pact and the UK Film Council, included interviews with industry experts and individuals.
1	They indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies.
1	The research indicated that about 10% of independent production companies in the UK are minority ethnic led.
1	A minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decision-making power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group.
1	The report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and TV industries.
1	It said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources, so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms.
1	The research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice, plus improved communication within the film and TV sectors.
1	The UK has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television, said Arts minister Estelle Morris of the findings.
1	I welcome this report which I hope will lead to more doors being opened and all businesses in our film and television industries being given the same opportunities. US TV special for tsunami relief A US television network will screen a celebrity TV special to benefit the tsunami relief effort in South Asia.
1	NBC will encourage viewer donations during an hour-long show featuring musical performances on 15 January.
1	Actress Sandra Bullock has donated $1m (£525,000) to The American Red Cross and actor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged a sizable aid contribution to Unicef.
1	Meanwhile 70 Hong Kong music and movie stars re-recorded We Are the World in Mandarin and Cantonese to raise funds.
1	The song will not be released as a single, but will be played regularly during a Chinese telethon on Friday in aid of victims of the Boxing Day disaster.
1	Around 140,000 people were killed and five million left homeless or without food and water after an earthquake below the Indian Ocean sent waves crashing into coastal communities in 11 countries.
1	The United Nations warned that the number killed in the disaster could rise sharply, with aid yet to reach some remote areas.
1	Performers have yet to be confirmed for NBCs aid relief benefit later this month.
1	It follows a two-hour telethon carried by all four major US television networks 10 days after the 11 September terror attacks in 2001.
1	America: A Tribute to Heroes raised more than $150m (£79m) to help victims of the suicide attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
1	Gervais writing Simpsons episode The Offices Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.
1	Gervais has already begun writing the script but is keeping its subject matter a closely guarded secret.
1	He will also write a part for himself in the episode.
1	Ive got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career.
1	The Simpsons is the greatest TV show of all time, he said.
1	Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - its one of the best shows on TV in the last decade. Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials.
1	The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America.
1	The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.
1	In winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace.
1	An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original.
1	At the British Comedy Awards on Wednesday, Gervais was handed a special achievement award for writing.
1	But The Office missed out in the best comedy show category to Little Britain.
1	Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.
1	John Peel replacement show begins The permanent replacement for late DJ John Peels BBC Radio 1 show goes on air on Tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenters slot.
1	Rock DJ Huw Stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every Tuesday, with black music champion Ras Kwame on Wednesdays and dance DJ Rob Da Bank on Thursdays.
1	Rob Da Bank filled in after Peel had a heart attack aged 65 in October.
1	All three will play diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial songs under the banner of the OneMusic show.
1	Radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the challenge of keeping his legacy alive with unpredictable music.
1	The three DJs were chosen for their in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres, the station said.
1	Rob Da Bank is one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music.
1	Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales.
1	And Ras Kwame is host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1s digital station 1Xtra, dedicated to showcasing the best hip-hop and garage.
1	Another change to the station line-up will see Sara Cox return after maternity leave.
1	She will host the lunchtime show on Saturdays from this week.
1	Good luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so its probably a good idea to get them all contributing.
1	This time next year I hope we are saying how well these DJs have done, but I fear this time next year we will really realise how much John Peel will be forever missed.
1	Very good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace John Peel.
1	Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name.
1	Congratulations! The whole glory of John Peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre.
1	He played what he liked across the range of music...  this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have.
1	Bring back Steve Lamacq.
1	The obvious heir to John Peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented Claire Kember from totallyradio.
1	com.
1	This lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in British broadcasting today.
1	Everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary John Peel.
1	BBC Radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general.
1	Brookside actress Keaveney dies Actress Anna Keaveney, who appeared in Brookside, My Family and A Touch of Frost, has died of lung cancer aged 55.
1	Keaveney, who played Brooksides Marie Jackson when the Channel 4 soap began in 1982, died on Saturday.
1	Born in Runcorn, Cheshire, she also starred in numerous films including 1989s Shirley Valentine.
1	She played Nellie in Mike Leighs latest film Vera Drake, which won the Golden Lion prize for best film at this years Venice Film Festival.
1	And most recently she appeared alongside Richard Wilson in ITVs King of Fridges and with Martin Clunes in Doc Martin.
1	Other TV appearances included the part of Matron in ITV drama Footballers Wives and a cameo role as Tom Farrells mother Sheila in BBC comedy Gimme Gimme Gimme.
1	Keaveneys career also included stage performances in Neaptide for the National Theatre, Private Lives and The Rise and Fall of Little Voice.
1	The actress died in hospital.
1	Her agent Barry Brown said: Anna was due to have had another operation on Friday but unfortunately she was too weak. &#163;1.8m indecency fine for Viacom Media giant Viacom has paid out $3.5m (£1.8m) to end investigations into indecency in its US radio and TV shows.
1	The settlement to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ends a long-running saga dating back to 2001.
1	The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by shock jock Howard Stern and two New York DJs.
1	Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church.
1	After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.
1	It also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws.
1	The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications.
1	The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States.
1	Viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement.
1	The payment is not related to the FCCs $550,000 (£293,000) fine levied against Viacom after the exposure of singer Janet Jacksons breast during the CBS Super Bowl halftime show in January.
1	Viacom is contesting that fine.
1	It is not the first time that Viacom has paid out over indecency charges.
1	Infinity Broadcasting, which is owned by Viacom, paid cumulative fines totalling $1.7m (£907,000) in 1995 to settle FCC violations by Stern.
1	Celebrities get to stay in jungle All four contestants still remain in Im A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here as no evictions were made on the television show on Saturday.

1	The celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp.
1	Appleton had endured a torrid time during the programme, including a well-publicised row with Sophie Anderton.
1	And on 26 November singer Brian Harvey quit as a contestant after he had a blazing row with Janet Street-Porter.
1	Triple triumph for Little Britain Top TV cult hit Little Britain has triumphed over The Office at the 15th annual British Comedy Awards.
1	The BBC show beat The Office Christmas Special in the best TV comedy category and took the peoples choice award.
1	Matt Lucas and David Walliams also jointly won best TV comedy actor over The Office creator Ricky Gervais, who won a special award for writing.

1	The Geordie duo also secured best comedy entertainment programme for Saturday Night Takeaway, beating Im A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, which they also host, and the BBCs Have I Got News For You.
1	The ceremony was presented by Jonathan Ross from ITVs London Studios headquarters on the capitals South Bank.
1	Little Britain began life as a radio series on Radio 4, with Walliams and Lucas playing a range of misfit characters from an alternative Britain.
1	It was later commissioned for BBC Three, where it proved a huge success, with the second series also shown on BBC One.
1	After receiving his award for best TV comedy actor with Walliams, Lucas said: Its a great honour to be nominated alongside Ricky Gervais and Martin Clunes. The show also won the peoples choice award, which is the only gong on the night voted for by viewers.
1	Speaking after receiving the award for best comedy, Walliams said: It was a real shock but I dont think we deserved to beat The Office which is a great show and more than just a comedy.
1	Its a beautiful piece of work. Gervais and The Office co-writer Stephen Merchant received a special award for writing, presented by Noel Gallagher and Tom Stoppard.
1	Gervais said: The show has won an awful lot of awards in the last couple of years, too much.
1	Its got embarrassing to be honest. Other winners at the awards included Caroline Quentin, who took home best TV comedy actress for Life Begins and Von Trapped.

1	Matt Lucas & David Walliams (Little Britain, BBC Three) Caroline Quentin (Life Begins/ Von Trapped, ITV1) Ant & Dec (Ant & Decs Saturday Night Takeaway/ Im A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here!, ITV1) Catherine Tate (The Catherine Tate Show, BBC Two) Nighty Night (Baby Cow Productions, BBC Three) Little Britain (BBC Three) Doc Martin (Buffalo Productions, ITV1) Ant & Decs Saturday Night Takeaway (Granada, ITV1) The Simpsons (Twentieth Century Fox, BBC Two/Sky One/Channel 4) School Of Rock BBC should allow more scrutiny MPs have urged the BBC to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how £2bn in licence fee money is spent.
1	The Public Accounts Committee called for the National Audit Office to be given a free hand to investigate how the BBC offers value for money.
1	Although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated, the MPs said.
1	The call was made in a report into the BBCs Freeview digital service.
1	Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money, said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh.
1	The BBCs spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny, and accountability to parliament.
1	Parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general, on behalf of parliament, to be able to scrutinise how that money, over £2 billion a year, is used. A BBC spokeswoman said: We share the committees interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well.
1	Though in its infancy, we think the arrangements with the NAO are working well and should be given time to mature. The report said the Freeview digital service has had an impressive take up since its launch but the BBC must still dispel confusion about the service.
1	The committee found the BBC had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002.
1	But the fact that one in four homes could not access Freeview remained a problem.
1	The report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues, there was need for detailed explanations on the Freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas.
1	The government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal, with 2012 the most recently proposed date.
1	The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen.
1	There have been an estimated five million Freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably.
1	The corporation plans to spend up to £138m on Freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the UK, and are aware of it.
1	Greer attacks bully Big Brother Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brothers bullying of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.
1	She said superior bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying.
1	She also condemned the complete irresponsibility of adding Brigitte Nielsens former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday.
1	Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said.
1	The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved like a child rather than a parent by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink.
1	I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground, Greer said.
1	She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking agendas.
1	I had no idea who would be in here and its wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are. Media observers had been surprised by Greers initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past.
1	As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: Im leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I dont discuss them.
1	I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them. Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.
1	Other celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left Im A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.
1	Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.
1	VOTE Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother? Yes No Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion Happy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1.
1	Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still wide open, adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1.
1	DJ Lisa IAnson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1.
1	The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greers exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors.
1	The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes.
1	For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programmes run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.
1	No charges against TVs Cosby US comedian Bill Cosby will not face charges stemming from an allegation of sexual misconduct.
1	Authorities in Philadelphia said they found insufficient evidence to support the womans allegations regarding an alleged incident in January 2004.
1	The woman reported the allegations to Canadian authorities last month.
1	Cosbys lawyer, Walter M Phillips Jr, said the comedian was pleased with the decision.
1	He looks forward to moving on with his life, he said.
1	District Attorney Bruce L Castor Jr, who was in charge of the case, said that detectives could find no instance where anyone complained to law enforcement of conduct which would constitute a criminal offence.
1	He also said that the fact the woman waited a year before coming forward, and she had had further contact with Cosby during that time, were also factors in his decision.
1	The unidentified womans lawyer, Dolores M Troiani, said her client was likely to sue the comedian.
1	I think thats the only avenue open to her.
1	She felt, as we did, that its a very strong case and she was telling the truth. She also said that the woman supplied further evidence to prosecutors that she believed strengthened her allegations.
1	Cosby emerged as one of the first black comics to have mainstream success in the US.
1	He was a successful stand-up before hosting the childrens show Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, and starring in The Cosby Show, one of the biggest sitcoms of the 1980s.
1	Wife Swap makers sue US copycat The British producers of US Wife Swap are taking legal action against a show they claim is a blatant and wholescale copycat of their programme.
1	RDF Media, which makes the show for US network ABC, has filed a damages claim for $18 million (£9.25 million) against Foxs Trading Spouses.
1	ABC bought the rights to the British show, which was first aired in 2003 and became a hit on Channel 4.
1	The US network is not part of the claim, but has supported RDFs action.
1	We respect our producing partners right to protect their intellectual property in whatever manner they deem most appropriate, said ABC in a statement.
1	A spokesman for Fox said it had not seen the details of the legal action and could not comment.
1	Their show was first screened in June, and was criticised in the press for its similarities to Wife Swap.
1	ABC originally planned to call their programme Trading Moms, but changed it to avoid confusion with the Fox version.
1	Earlier this year, the NBC network claimed that Foxs boxing show The Next Great Champ had been hurriedly produced to ensure its programme was the first to be screened.
1	NBC alleged that boxing regulations had been violated, but failed in their attempt to have the show pulled.
1	The Fox show proved a ratings flop, while NBCs The Contender is due to begin in February.
1	Show over for MTVs The Osbournes Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has said his family will not make any more episodes of reality TV show The Osbournes.
1	At the end of it I didnt like having cameras around the house all the time, the Black Sabbath singer told reporters at the MTV Europe Awards in Rome.
1	His wife Sharon, who also appears in the popular MTV show based on the Osbournes family life, agreed.
1	Now everybodys doing reality shows.
1	Hes done it, hes been there, hes got to do something else, she said.
1	Ozzy Osbourne said he had had enough of the work involved in making the series.
1	When you watch a 25-minute episode, Ive been filming all day, he said.
1	Sharon Osbourne is currently appearing as a judge and mentor in ITV1 talent show The X-Factor alongside Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh.
1	Earlier this year she topped a poll of the most important people in rock, for her part in guiding the career of husband Ozzy and her family.
1	She was the driving force behind The Osbournes, which ran for three series, earning the family a reported $85m (£46m).
1	The renewed popularity for Ozzy has seen sales of his merchandise hit the $50m (£27.2m) mark, a record for a heavy metal artist.
1	Sales of T-shirts, accessories and action figures have rocketed since The Osbournes hit screens.
1	At its peak, The Osbournes had a regular audience of eight million, with Americas TV Guide magazine describing the series as a cross between The Simpsons and This Is Spinal Tap.
1	Osbourne himself was at a loss to explain its popularity: I suppose Americans get a kick out of watching a crazy Brit family like us make complete fools of ourselves every week. Jungle TV show ratings drop by 4m The finale of ITV1s Im a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here drew an average of 10.9m viewers - about four million fewer than the previous series.
1	The fourth series of the show peaked on Monday at 11.9m and 49.2% of the audience, just before Joe Pasquale won.
1	This compared with a peak of 15.3m at and a record 62.2% of the TV audience when Kerry McFadden won in February.
1	Comic Pasquale beat former Royal butler Paul Burrell who came second, nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave, who was third.
1	Pasquale follows Kerry McFadden, Phil Tufnell and Tony Blackburn as winners of the show.
1	Singer and TV presenter McFadden was the shows first female winner.
1	When cricketer Phil Tufnell won in May 2003, 12.3 million people - 50% of the viewing public - tuned in to watch.
1	And when Tony Blackburn won the first show in 2002, 10.9 million people saw the show.
1	Pasquale had been the shows hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Mondays deciding vote was the closest in the programmes history.
1	Pascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.
1	Before joining Im a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show.
1	His manager Robert Voice said: Weve had interest from different TV producers.
1	Some are for comedy shows, some are new-type projects.
1	There are a number of things Joe wants to do.
1	He is very ambitious.
1	He wants to play the West End and do different things other than straightforward comedy.
1	We are talking to a couple of West End producers about a musical. Duran Duran show set for US TV Chart stars Duran Duran are to appear in a VH1 special in the US including interviews and concert footage.
1	The show airs on Tuesday and will feature a studio performance, behind the scenes footage and fan interviews.
1	They seemed like a perfect fit with our audience, said Rick Krim, VH1s vice president of music and talent.
1	The band recently released a new album, Astronaut, the first from the original line-up since 1983.
1	They will also tour Japan and the US next year.
1	When we started playing together, we didnt try and make a really sort of mature album.
1	We just really wanted to make a great Duran Duran album, said keyboard player Nick Rhodes.
1	Its pretty much in line with a lot of stuff out there. Duran Duran are currently promoting the albums second single, What Happens Tomorrow.
1	Simon Le Bon said earlier this year that the group were not trying to update their sound too much.
1	We wouldnt want to lose them [older fans] by trying too hard by trying to connect with a new audience, the singer said.
1	Le Bon also said the five members were getting on very well.
1	Were like any people who get very close.
1	Sometimes you argue with each other.
1	But the fact is we inspire each other musically.
1	Nobody else does it for me, he said.
1	Its just very special. US show sued for rat-eating stunt A US TV network is being sued for $2.5m (£1.3m) by a viewer who says he was disgusted by watching contestants eat dead rats in a stunt show.
1	Austin Aitken is taking action against NBC over its programme Fear Factor.
1	He said watching the show caused his blood pressure to rise so high that he became dizzy and light-headed.
1	The legal assistant said NBC was sending the wrong message to viewers that cash can make or have people do just about anything beyond reasoning.
1	The hand-written, four-page lawsuit said: To have the individuals on the show eat and drink dead rats was crazy and from a viewers point of view made me throw-up as well as another in the house at the same time. Mr Aitken, who lives in Cleveland, said that after becoming light-headed, he ran towards the bedroom and knocked his head in a doorway.
1	A spokesman for NBC said it had no comment on the lawsuit, but confirmed the stunt show did feature a rat-eating scene in New Yorks Times Square on 8 November.
1	Past shows have featured viewers eating spiders and live worms.
1	The programme has been screened in the UK on Sky One.
1	Muslim group attacks TV drama 24 A British Muslim group has criticised the new series of US drama 24, which is about to be aired on Sky One, claiming it portrays Islam unfairly.
1	The Muslim Council of Britain has complained to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.
1	It says the programme breaches editorial guidelines.
1	The groups members met with Sky executives on Tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes.
1	The drama, now in its fourth series, begins on Sunday evening.
1	The new series portrays a Muslim family as a sleeper terrorist cell.
1	The Muslim Council of Britain said in a statement: We are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of Muslims in this series of 24 based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen. There is not a single positive Muslim character in the storyline to date.
1	At a time when negative stereotypes of Muslims are on the increase we feel that Sky - as a major UK broadcaster - has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views, not help to reinforce them. But Sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines.
1	A spokesperson said: During a useful meeting yesterday, Sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council.
1	Sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach Ofcoms programme code. Fox TV, which shows the series in the US, is broadcasting public service announcements showing Muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series.
1	Brookside creators Channel 4 bid The creator of defunct TV soap Brookside has written to the culture minister to offer to buy Channel 4.
1	Phil Redmond, now chairman of Mersey TV, told Tessa Jowell he would run it with its current remit intact for the next 10 years.
1	But media watchdog Ofcom has said the the commercially funded public service broadcaster will not be privatised.
1	A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said there were no plans to sell the channel.
1	He added that primary legislation would be required for the station to be sold off, which the government was not intending to introduce.
1	Brookside was axed in 2003 after its ratings slumped from a peak of seven million to just 1.5 million.
1	Redmond also brought teen soap Hollyoaks to Channel 4 and created Grange Hill, the school-based drama serial which was first broadcast on BBC One in 1978.
1	He was awarded the CBE for services to drama earlier this year.
1	Little Britain two top comic list Little Britain stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams have been named the most powerful people in TV comedy, in a poll by listings magazine Radio Times.
1	The duo kept Phoenix Nights creator Peter Kay at number two and The Office star Ricky Gervais in third place.
1	A Radio Times panel compiled the list, taking the comedians critical acclaim and financial success into account.
1	Newcomers to the annual list included Nighty Night star Julia Davis at seven and Black Books Tamsin Greig at 19.
1	Lucas and Walliams won numerous awards for Little Britain in 2004, including National Television, Royal Television Society and British Comedy awards.
1	More than 1.8 million people watched the first episode of the latest series of Little Britain on BBC Three in October, giving the digital channel its highest rating ever.
1	They topped the Radio Times list after rising from 10th position last year.
1	Other big risers over the past year included presenting duo Ant and Dec at five, up from 13 in 2004, Stephen Fry rising nine places to 15 and BBC Three controller Stuart Murphy, who moves to number 18 from 32 last year.
1	Last years winner, chat show host Graham Norton, fell to number 16 following relatively few television appearances in 2004.
1	Production companies also featured in the top 50, including Steve Coogans Baby Cow, which created Nighty Night among others, Hat Trick - behind The Kumars at Number 42 - and The Vicar of Dibley production company Tiger Aspect.
1	TV show unites Angolan families Angolan families who are attempting to track each other down, after being separated by nearly 30 years of war, are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular TV show.
1	Meeting Point has become one of TV Angolas most watched programmes, and has reunited hundreds of families.
1	It runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio.
1	Every Friday, hundreds of people gather in Luandas Independence Square to record a message in front of the TV cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it.
1	Many relatives have been reunited on air.
1	At the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds, Sergio Gera, the programmes chief co-ordinator, told BBC World Services Assignment programme.
1	Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going. The media in the southern African country, twice the size of France, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives.
1	Hundreds of thousands of people died in Angolas 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing.
1	Many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90% of Angolan families have lost someone.
1	The idea of recording in Independence Square was modelled on a square in the Argentine capital Buenos Aries, where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing, and to exchange news.
1	One woman, Victoria Lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in Independence Square live on Meeting Point.
1	She had not seen her sibling for 28 years.
1	When we saw each other, we threw ourselves into each others arms, she told Assignment.
1	We started to cry.
1	I felt very, very happy, because Id spent so long without any family.
1	Suddenly I had a sister again. However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few.
1	This means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
1	In the city of Wambo, the ICRC runs the Gazetta - a 200-page, tabloid-size book which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced.
1	Their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country.
1	Its very difficult - there are many displaced, stated Joaquim Sahundi, head of tracing in Wambo.
1	As they try to go back [home], others are trying to relocate their relatives.
1	Many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines.
1	When people are crossing these areas, they step on mines. The ICRC also uses the media where it can, running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on Radio Angola.
1	Meanwhile, there remain massive challenges to Angolan families even once they are reunited.
1	The programme of family reunification is extremely important, but for these families to remain reunified, there has to be social integration, job access, education, healthcare, said Rafael Marques of the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa.
1	Essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - thats why it has been persistently calling for a donors conference.
1	That is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities. Volcano drama erupts on BBC One Supervolcano, a docu-drama about a volcanic eruption in Yellowstone National Park in the US, is among the highlights on the BBC One this winter.
1	The £178m winter schedule also includes the return of Doctor Who and a drama about Angela Cannings, who was wrongly convicted of killing two of her babies.
1	Sarah Lancashire and Timothy Spall will star in the real-life drama, Cherished.
1	ITV also unveiled their festive season on Tuesday, which includes Stephen Fry in a remake of Tom Browns Schooldays.
1	Supervolcano, follows in the footsteps of last years Pompei, which drew 10 million viewers to BBC One in October 2003.
1	The programme merges science, drama and computer imagery to reveal what could happen if Yellowstone - home to the only currently active supervolcano in the world - were to erupt again.
1	BBC Two will run a two-part documentary, The Science Behind Supervolcano, in conjunction with the transmission.
1	Other educational highlights include a documentary about infamous Mongolian warrior Genghis Khan and Grandchild of The Holocaust.
1	Grandchild of The Holocaust, part of the BBC commitment to Holocaust Memorial Day, follows Adrian, 13, on a journey to uncover the truth about what happened to his grandmother in Auschwitz and Belsen.
1	New drama includes Archangel, an adaptation of the Robert Harris best-seller, which stars Daniel Craig on the trail of Stalins diaries in Communist Russia.
1	And Sarah Waters gets her second adaptation on BBC One with Imelda Staunton and Charles Dance lined up to star in Fingersmith.
1	The adaptation, about a conman in Victorian England, will make an interesting contrast to Julie Burchills Sugar Rush - a lesbian teenage drama part of Channel Fours winter season.
1	On a lighter note, Jessica Stevenson will star in new BBC One sitcom, The World According to Bex, penned by My Family creator Fred Barron and the Two Ronnies return for a celebration of their classic comedy series.
1	Frys portrayal of headmaster Dr Arnold dominates a muted Christmas schedule on ITV1, which sees the channel retreat from broadcasting blockbuster movies in favour of extended soap episodes and popular quiz shows.
1	Sir Paul McCartney, wife Heather Mills and Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson will join a celebrity edition of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? on Christmas Day.
1	Also on Christmas Day, John Nettles will return in a one-off edition of Midsomer Murders, while two episodes of the new Miss Marple drama will air over the festive period.
1	Films on ITV1 include Gus Van Sants Finding Forrester, starring Sean Connery, and classics such a Mary Poppins, Star Wars and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
1	In contrast, BBCs Christmas season includes terrestrial debuts of the first Harry Potter film, Shrek and Steven Spielbergs AI, as well as new epipsodes of the Vicar of Dibley and the final Auf Wiedersehen, Pet.
1	South Bank Awards honour hit soap Coronation Street has become the first soap to triumph at the South Bank Show Awards, which traditionally reward highbrow and groundbreaking culture.
1	The soap beat fellow ITV1 show Filthy Love and Channel 4s Shameless to win the best TV drama prize on Thursday.
1	Little Britain was named best comedy while Franz Ferdinand beat Morrissey and The Libertines to the music award.
1	Shane Meadows Dead Mans Shoes picked up the best film award, beating Shaun of the Dead and My Summer of Love.
1	The two award ceremonies reflect the achievements the industry believes have been made in the last year.
1	In 2004, Coronation Street pulled away from its BBC One rival EastEnders in the ratings and dominated other TV awards.
1	Last year, the South Bank Award for best TV drama went to Steven Poliakoffs period piece The Lost Prince, while Bloody Sunday, about the 1972 killings in Northern Ireland, won in 2003.
1	In other South Bank categories, Little Britains second series beat Nighty Night and The Green Wing to the comedy trophy while Alan Bennetts The History Boys won in the theatre category.
1	Author David Mitchell made up for losing out in the Booker Prize to Alan Hollinghurst by beating him to the literary award with his book Cloud Atlas.
1	Shameless, State Of Play and Clocking Off creator Paul Abbott got a lifetime achievement award while former Grange Hill actress Amma Asante won the breakthrough award for writing and directing her first film, A Way Of Life.
1	Housewives lift Channel 4 ratings The debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4s January audience share by 12% compared to last year.
1	Other successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC2 for the first month since last July.
1	However the channels share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004.
1	Celebrity Big Brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series.
1	Comedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience.
1	The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Fives proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%.
1	Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004.
1	Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.
1	Baywatch dubbed worst TV import Surf show Baywatch has won the title of worst TV import of all time in a poll of UK television executives.
1	The programme, which starred David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson during its 12-year run, was shown in 140 countries at its height.
1	Model Anna Nicole Smiths reality show and The Dukes of Hazzard were runners-up in the Broadcast magazine survey.
1	The Simpsons and Dallas and 24 were among the magazines list of the best all-time imports from the US.
1	Soap operas Knots Landing, Falcon Crest plus The Bold And The Beautiful all made the top 10 of Transatlantic TV howlers.
1	The Jerry Springer Show, which came in at sixth on the list, did not fare well.
1	Broadcast magazine said: British TV never realised how low it could go before Jerry showed the way. Baywatch rose to the top of the list for having mind-numbingly predictable scripts: beachgoer is saved from drowning, according to the magazine.
1	Just inside the all-time worst top 10 came Extreme Makeover, which sees members of the public given thousands of pounds worth of plastic surgery.
1	Other American shows which won praise were The X-Files, I Love Lucy, Twin Peaks and Star Trek.
1	Stern dropped from radio stations Controversial DJ Howard Stern has been dropped from four US radio stations because he keeps promoting his move to a network broadcasting on satellite.
1	Cidatel Broadcasting said Stern had transformed his show into a continuous infomercial promoting Sirius, his new satellite radio employer.
1	Stern will join the Sirius subscription service, which is not governed by US regulators, next year.
1	Citadel pulled Sterns show from stations in New York and Pennsylvania.
1	Stern had been holiday for two weeks but his show did not return to the four stations as expected on 3 January.
1	Citadel said it did not yet know whether it would return to its network.
1	Stern announced in October that he was leaving conventional radio, where his syndicated show goes out across the US, for the relatively restriction-free satellite service.
1	The DJs broadcasts are well known for landing in trouble with regulators for obscene and sexually explicit rantings.
1	Stern was dropped by six stations owned by media giant Clear Channel in 2004 after it had to pay the Federal Communications Commission $1.75m (£950,000), over breaches indecency laws.
1	Media giant Viacom has also reportedly agreed to the FCCs demands that if Stern is issued with another indecency violation then his show must be pulled from all of its stations.
1	Viacom has also been hit with record fines of $3.5m (£1.8m) over Stern and two other New York DJs.
1	But Stern continues to be one of the most popular talk show hosts, particularly in the 25-54 age category.
1	US TV host Clark suffers stroke Veteran US television host Dick Clark is in hospital in Los Angeles after suffering a mild stroke.
1	The 75-year-old presented long-running show American Bandstand from 1956-87 and has since hosted game shows and produced award ceremonies.
1	Clark is scheduled to welcome in the New Year on the ABC network, a job he has done for 33 years.
1	The presenter said that he is hopeful of getting better in time to lead the festivities in New Yorks Times Square.
1	Clarks publicist Paul Shefrin said the television host was recovering and there was no cause for alarm.
1	Clark, who produces the Golden Globe and American Music Awards, disclosed last year that he was suffering from diabetes.
1	His popular music show American Bandstand was first broadcast in 1952, and attracted an audience of 20 million people after it was picked up by ABC in 1957.
1	The long-running weekly series, which featured guests including Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Aretha Frankin, came to an end in 1989.
1	Clark was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contribution to the music industry.
1	He has also been responsible for television series such as TV Bloopers, Celebrity Boxing and drama American Dreams.
1	Clark is also expected to act as executive producer for the upcoming Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which is taking place on 16 January.
1	New media battle for Bafta awards The BBC leads the nominations for the Bafta Interactive Awards, including one for the Radio Times website and one for Sport Interactives Euro 2004 coverage.
1	The awards, which were started in 1997, recognise the best websites, digital TV shows and CD roms.
2	Guantanamo man suing government A British terror suspect held in Guantanamo Bay for 33 months plans to sue the government, it is reported.
2	Martin Mubanga claimed in the Observer that an MI6 officer played a key role in consigning him to the US camp in Cuba, following his arrest in Zambia.
2	Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp.
2	The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not well informed.
2	Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.
2	He said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002.
2	Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam.
2	But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead.
2	Mr Mubanga said the MI6 agent told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission.
2	Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.
2	His lawyer Louise Christian said: We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo. And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubangas transfer to Guantanamo.
2	But a Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of British intelligence or security agencies.
2	And Home Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC Ones Breakfast with Frost: Im not organising a specific investigation into it. Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview.
2	He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.
2	He claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts.
2	And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot.
2	Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: Ive lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim.
2	He added: The authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me.
2	Theyve made me what I am - even if Im not quite sure yet who that person is. The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture.
2	In a statement, it said: The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war.
2	He was detained to prevent him from fighting against the US and our allies in the war on terror. But Fair Trials Abroad director Stephen Jakobi said there were similarities between Mr Mubangas account and those of other Guantanamo detainees.
2	He said: The pattern is the same.
2	The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo.
2	Is [Charles Clarke] really pretending this is all made up? Mr Mubanga and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.
2	Council tax rise reasonable Welsh councils should set their taxes at reasonable levels after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.
2	Finance Minister Sue Essex said it was a good deal for local government.
2	The £3.2bn settlement includes the full £7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown.
2	But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises.
2	In addition, £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates.
2	She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that significant cuts to services may still be unavoidable.
2	After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed.
2	A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems, said Mr Wellington.
2	It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase. On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds.
2	Ms Essex said: I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises.
2	I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties. She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, even for those people who have moved up a band.
2	The settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support.
2	Ms Essex said: This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax.
2	It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level. Plaid Cymrus local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement hugely disappointing.
2	He said: Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again.
2	This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger. This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both. Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding.
2	Mr German said: I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum.
2	But the random redistribution effect of rebanding... will create a great deal of difficulty. Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change is taking spin to the very verge of deception.
2	He added: Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures. Blunkett row should end - Blair Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.
2	The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunketts ex-lovers nanny.
2	Sir Alan Budd found a chain of events linked Mr Blunkett to Leoncia Casalmes indefinite leave to remain application.
2	At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.
2	On Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinns nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average.
2	But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunketts intervention was intended to give special help for his then lovers nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance.
2	In his first comments since Sir Alans announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail.
2	But told BBC News: As far as Im concerned, we have drawn a line under that. Asked if Mr Blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains.
2	Hes been a tremendous colleague, hes done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary.
2	The future is something we will have to approach in the future. The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a grubby government.
2	He said Mr Blunketts integrity remained intact: He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up.
2	He accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened, he said.
2	But I think Sir Alan Budd also accepted there wasnt some conspiracy or cover-up and I just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on. Earlier, Mr Howard said: There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry.
2	There were so many questions that werent answered. There was deceit at the heart of government which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued.
2	Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was a strong case for a judge-led judicial review.
2	He said: Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa.
2	It may be about something even more important than that. Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alans findings.
2	In a statement, the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquirys findings.
2	He said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.
2	Minimum rate for foster parents Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced.
2	Payment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just £50 a week for clothes, food and other costs.
2	Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers allowances would be as fair as possible.
2	However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found.
2	About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.
2	Ms Hodge said: Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society.
2	We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible.
2	Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity. The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.
2	Fostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system.
2	There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live.
2	And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, its not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets. The charity recommends a weekly payment of £108.49 for looking after a baby.
2	In a survey, it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as £100 per week.
2	The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principle with the governments plans.
2	Tony Hunter, the organisations president, said: There are many devils and lots of details hidden within the Governments proposals.
2	But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges. Royal couple watch nations mood Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nations reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.
2	Mrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle.
2	A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couples decision to marry.
2	But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king.
2	Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.
2	The poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication.
2	On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement.
2	Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: Im just coming down to earth. She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters.
2	Charles said he and his wife-to-be were absolutely delighted.
2	Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.
2	The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them very happy.
2	Princes William and Harry said they are very happy and wish the couple all the luck in the future.
2	The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St Georges Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.
2	The marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive.
2	If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees.
2	His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles], said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales.
2	The Archbishop of Canterbury said: I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step. Tony Blair said he was delighted for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.
2	Australias Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a sensible and a good thing.
2	Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Princes Trust.
2	Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.
2	Muslim police stops more likely UK Muslims should accept that people of Islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a Home Office minister has said.
2	Hazel Blears said innocent Muslims would be targeted because of the search for Islamic extremists.
2	Qualifications for religious leaders to enter the UK could also be made tougher, she told a Commons inquiry.
2	Her comments have been described as irresponsible and outrageous by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC).
2	The threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of Islam, or who are falsely hiding behind Islam, the Salford MP told the Commons home affairs committee.
2	It means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community. It was a reality that should be recognised, she said.
2	If a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area, she added.
2	On ministers of religions, such as imams, she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded.
2	Last year, ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak English to a certain level.
2	IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of playing an Islamophobia card in the run-up to a general election.
2	She is demonising and alienating our community, he said.
2	It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community.
2	This sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists. Later, the prime ministers official spokesman urged people to put Ms Blears comments into context.
2	The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.
2	What is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community.
2	It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community, he added.
2	Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.
2	Figures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year.
2	Separate figures on police searches in England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted.
2	Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws.
2	In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian people, even though they make up 4.7% of the population.
2	Last July, the police were accused of Islamophobia by Muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws.
2	Howard attacks cost of asylum Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britains chaotic asylum system under Tony Blair.
2	The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997.
2	Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters tolerance and desire to help others are being abused.
2	Other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked Tory plans for annual limits on numbers.
2	Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the worlds genuine refugees.
2	The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution, he was due to say.
2	But if we are to fulfil responsibility, we have to get a grip of the system.
2	Fair play matters.
2	People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused, he said.
2	And lets be clear.
2	Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britains generosity. Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his partys plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees.
2	If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.
2	That prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.
2	If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven, said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council.
2	If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away.
2	Michael Howards policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK.
2	When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers.
2	So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities.
2	We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much. Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans.
2	By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse, said Mr Blair.
2	Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.
2	But he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.
2	The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.
2	On Monday, Mr Howard said: Its not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it. Brown outlines third term vision Gordon Brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of New Labours next general election bid.
2	He said ensuring every child in Britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the NHSs creation.
2	The chancellor has previously planned the partys election strategy but this time the role will be filled by Alan Milburn - a key ally of Tony Blair.
2	The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labours campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.
2	Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking.
2	As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labours ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities. BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Browns article was a warning shot to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.
2	It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate, was Mr Marrs assessment.
2	The prime minister was asked about Mr Browns article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4s Today programme.
2	Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellors role would be central.
2	Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of Mr Browns management of the economy.
2	And he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of Labours manifesto.
2	He also predicted the next general election will be a tough, tough fight for New Labour.
2	But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May.
2	Mr Blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labours majority instead of hoping for an outright win.
2	Super union merger plan touted Two of Britains big trade unions could merge to form a super union of two million members.
2	The move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers.
2	Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000.
2	Any merger would have to be approved by the unions executives and their membership.
2	It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal.
2	Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labours leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement.
2	Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda when the two unions executives hold their meetings on Wednesday.
2	Amicuss executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.
2	UK firms embracing e-commerce UK firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before, e-commerce minister Mike OBrien says.
2	A government-commissioned study ranked the UK third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ICT).
2	The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online.
2	Mr OBrien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead.
2	The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.
2	It showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences.
2	Mr OBrien said: The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring.
2	It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years. The government would play its part in cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish, Mr OBrien said.
2	The clear message the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.
2	However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy, he added.
2	The International Benchmarking Study was based on 8,000 telephone interviews with businesses, of which more than 2,700 were UK businesses.
2	It is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ICT in the worlds most industrialised nations.
2	UK heading wrong way - Howard Tony Blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing Britain and has failed, Michael Howard has said.
2	Britain is heading in the wrong direction, the Conservative leader said in his New Year message.
2	Mr Blairs government was a bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals, he added.
2	But Labours campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: Britain is working, dont let the Tories wreck it again.
2	Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nations character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster.
2	The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.
2	We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief.
2	The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp.
2	Yet Britains response has shone a light on our nations character.
2	The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever. He went on to reflect on the values that most Britons hold dear.
2	Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing Britain.
2	How much tax do people want to pay? Who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system? Mr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the wrong solution to them.
2	The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice.
2	Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted peoples money and failed to tackle the problems families face today. The Tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.
2	We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.
2	We simply need to change direction.
2	The election will give Britain the chance to change. This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.
2	But Labour spokesman Mr Kemp said: It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January. Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax.
2	With Labour Britain is working.
2	Rather than alluding to false promises Michael Howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the British people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.
2	Kilroy launches Veritas party Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk has said he wants to change the face of British politics as he launched his new party.
2	Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party,said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration.
2	He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for truth - would avoid the old parties lies and spin.
2	UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he was glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.
2	Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.
2	He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.
2	And he announced the party would be holding a leadership election.
2	On Thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoons Ashfield seat.
2	He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIPs two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas deputy leader.
2	UKIPs chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.
2	Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his decision to quit UKIP at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week.
2	It came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.
2	He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had gone AWOL after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last Junes European elections.
2	While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not, he said.
2	I will be standing at the next general election.
2	I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in.
2	And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight. Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would deliver better as the leader of a Eurosceptic party.
2	A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly.
2	The party asserts that Mr Hockney has a moral obligation, if not a legal one to stand down.
2	Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.
2	He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now goodbye, he said.
2	UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.
2	This is just what the Europhiles pray for.
2	As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.
2	Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.
2	Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election! It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP.
2	Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer.
2	Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.
2	Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.
2	Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk.
2	It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.
2	UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.
2	This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.
2	Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes.
2	Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.
2	If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.
2	So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow! Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name! Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country.
2	Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue.
2	He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience.
2	We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes.
2	It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians.
2	Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities.
2	Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come! Well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party.
2	Its all flash and no real policy here Lets hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.
2	Veritas? The name will doom it.
2	But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that? Blair damaged by Blunkett row A majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over David Blunketts involvement in a visa application, a poll suggests.
2	But nearly half those surveyed said Mr Blunkett should return to Cabinet if Labour won the next election.
2	Some 63% of respondents in the Sunday Times poll thought his former lover - Kimberly Quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign.
2	YouGov polled a weighted sample of 1,981 voters online on 16-18 December.
2	Mr Blunkett resigned as Home Secretary on Wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by Mrs Quinns former nanny had been speeded up.
2	Sir Alan Budds inquiry also found Mr Blunketts account of events had been wrong.
2	Almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the Sunday Times said he should return to the Cabinet straight after the election.
2	One in four said he should be back in the Governments top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.
2	Three-quarters said Mr Blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see Mrs Quinns son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for Mrs Quinn.
2	A total of 53% of those polled said they had sympathy for Mr Blunkett, with 40% saying they did not.
2	Forty-three per cent thought Mr Blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17% disagreed.
2	Meantime, 32% said Mr Blair was a good prime minister and 38% disagreed.
2	A majority, 52%, said Chancellor Gordon Brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.
2	A second poll for the Independent on Sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the Blunkett controversy.
2	Labour lead the Conservatives by 39% to 34% with the Liberal Democrats on 19%.
2	CommunicateResearch interviewed 401 people before David Blunketts resignation and 601 afterwards.
2	Some 82% said Mr Blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his, but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming.
2	Thirty per cent said the affair showed Mr Blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%, disagreed.
2	MPs shock at long lost daughter Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was out of control during the wild 1960s.
2	Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as Precious at school.
2	Despite being told he was a nutter who died at sea she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited.
2	Lucys mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks.
2	Mr Pound found out about it last year.
2	That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.
2	Mr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasnt dead. He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a set-up but he then realised all the dates fitted.
2	It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending.
2	I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones, said the Ealing North MP.
2	I dont blame Lucys mother.
2	I was pretty much out of control.
2	I was 18 when she was conceived.
2	It was a different time - it was pretty wild. Mr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since.
2	Describing that first meeting at Londons King Cross station, he said: The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection.
2	We were finishing each other sentences. Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children.
2	Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.
2	Green fear for transport ballot The Green Party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in Edinburghs transport referendum.
2	Edinburgh City Council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital.
2	But Green MSP Mark Ballard fears people not on the councils edited electoral register may miss out.
2	Local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters, such as the transport referendum.
2	Therefore, residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote.
2	However, there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of Februarys voting deadline.
2	Mr Ballard said: This vote will set the future of transport in Edinburgh for decades to come.
2	It is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in Edinburgh City and the surrounding areas, are registered to vote in the ballot.
2	Many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say.
2	Everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible, and that means encouraging people to take part. The ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the councils proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it.
2	The outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council.
2	Towards the end of February, the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to Scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.
2	New drink limit would cut toll More lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says.
2	University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.
2	The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the governments Road Safety Bill.
2	The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit.
2	The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UKs roads compared with 2003.
2	He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year.
2	A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport Document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year.
2	The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking.
2	Professor Allsop said: Reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the drivers BAC [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit.
2	Only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times. Ministers do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties.
2	They believe educating drivers is more important.
2	The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers attitudes to drink-driving.
2	Road safety head Andrew Howard said: It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.
2	Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully.
2	Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone. Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso said drink-driving remained a major killer, with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking.
2	He said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving.
2	The Road Safety Bill, which gets its second reading on Tuesday, would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed.
2	It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system, penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over.
2	These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties.
2	In an article for the Times newspaper, Ms Dunwoody, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, says: Slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists.
2	It is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph, they have a 50 per cent chance of survival.
2	If you are going at 40mph, nine times out of ten they will die. CSA could close, says minister Ministers would not rule out scrapping the Child Support Agency if it failed to improve, Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Johnson has warned.
2	But he said replacing the controversial CSA would be the nuclear option.
2	A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks.
2	Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced. The committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed.
2	It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was fit for purpose, describing it as a failing organisation and in crisis with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations.
2	The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the abandonment option, to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.
2	And responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: I certainly wouldnt rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system.
2	But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isnt going to work. The MPs launched their inquiry into the CSAs performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up.
2	The MPs found the £456m system from American IT giant EDS was nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate.
2	Faced with the committees criticism, the government has suspended its plan to cut the agencys staff by 25%.
2	The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.
2	It is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m, while a further £947m has been designated as unrecoverable.
2	Michelle, a mother of twins, said she had not received a penny of the £57 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an on-going battle with the CSA.
2	Her forms have twice been lost in the post, she said.
2	I dont receive correspondence, I dont receive phone calls, I have to chase them all the time, she said.
2	Theresa May, Tory shadow work and pensions secretary, said: We have got to find a way thats going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them. The agencys former chief executive Doug Smith quit last autumn claiming he was seriously disappointed with its performance.
2	The committee said the National Audit Office should investigate why the EDS system had gone so badly wrong.
2	It blamed the agencys senior management for a multitude of problems within the agency, including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff.
2	Boothroyd calls for Lords speaker Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber.
2	Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind.
2	Now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it, she told the BBCs Breakfast with Frost.
2	In 1999 Labour removed all but 92 of the Lords 750 hereditary peers.
2	That was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution.
2	The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto.
2	I think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the Lords and the Commons, Lord Falconer told BBC1s Breakfast With Frost.
2	How it interacts with the Commons is a very, very important issue.
2	We need to address the issue in the manifesto, but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes. The lord chancellor currently has the role of House of Lords speaker.
2	He is also head of the judiciary and a member of the Cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary.
2	Lady Boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of Speaker.
2	I would really like to see a Speaker of the House of Lords, she said.
2	I dont go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords.
2	I want somebody there who is going to look after that House and do a job there.
2	Bid to cut court witness stress New targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.
2	Lord Falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years.
2	More video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms.
2	It is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.
2	Ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice.
2	Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs plan, Lord Falconer said: One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims.
2	The needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.
2	Courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant. He went on: Giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience, especially when youre a victim.
2	Yet with a will and with support it can be done. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4s Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence.
2	Other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts.
2	You are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence, he said.
2	But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, its not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them. The plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses.
2	Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday.
2	Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this.
2	Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament.
2	The person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the House of Lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either House of Parliament.
2	What they did, not what they were called, was the critical issue, he added.
2	Lord Scarman, 93, dies peacefully Distinguished lawyer Lord Scarman, who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 Brixton riots, has died aged 93.
2	The peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as Law Commission chairman in its first seven years.
2	He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland.
2	Paying tribute, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the great advocates of our generation.
2	His legacy from his decisions in the Lords and the Court of Appeal is substantial.
2	His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.
2	A great judge, a great lawyer and a great man. Lord Scarmans nephew George Ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on Wednesday, would be sadly missed.
2	The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, who is the most senior judge in England and Wales, said it was Lord Scarmans pioneering work which paved the way for the Human Rights Act 1998.
2	He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society, he said.
2	He was, personally, totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the Family Justice Division, said Lord Scarman was a good and humane judge and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century.
2	Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery.
2	During the following three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands, Merseyside, Bristol and Leeds, nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.
2	The inquiry famously settled on the so-called rotten apples theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not.
2	It spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the Police Complaints Authority.
2	Trevor Phillips, chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, praised Lord Scarmans ability to listen.
2	He said: When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying.
2	A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment.
2	His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds, many of whose language he could barely understand, genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings.
2	He never lost the special combination of wisdom, humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots. Tory leader urges Harry apology Prince Harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a Nazi uniform to a friends fancy dress party, says Tory leader Michael Howard.
2	Mr Howard, whose grandmother died in Auschwitz, said many people would be offended by the princes actions Clarence House has issued a statement saying the prince has apologised and realised it had been a poor costume.
2	Number 10 said an error was made but now Harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace.
2	That was a message repeated by Home Secretary Charles Clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie.
2	But Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said Harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person.
2	There is a reservoir of goodwill for Prince Harry, and Prince William with him, in this country, but I think he needs to remember that it cant last forever. He added that Sandhurst would probably be good for Harry as it would teach him some self discipline.
2	Former Labour MP Lord Janner, who is a high profile member of Britains Jewish community, branded Harrys actions stupid and evil.
2	He told ITV: The time has come for him to make a public apology.
2	It is about common decency, of respect to the people who fought the Nazis, to the families of those who were killed by the Nazis and to people who suffered during the Holocaust. He added: I would send him in the army as fast as possible.
2	I hope that would teach him not to behave like that. A photograph of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband and German desert uniform at the party appears in Thursdays Sun newspaper under the headline: Harry the Nazi. Mr Howard acknowledged the princes apology and said he had no doubt the princes father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident.
2	But he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: It might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is. Mr Howard declined to say what form the statement should take.
2	But former Buckingham Palace press spokesman Dicky Arbiter said the prince should make a personal, broadcast apology.
2	Mr Clarke said he recognised peoples concerns about the costume but argued: He has apologised and I think we should leave the matter there. NHS waiting time target is cut Hospital waiting times for patients in Wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in England.
2	Welsh Health Minister Jane Hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by March 2006, against a current target of 18 months.
2	But she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for March 2006.
2	The announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop.
2	This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.
2	Details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the New Year.
2	In England, the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months.
2	Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), welcomed the new targets to make further and faster progress on waiting lists.
2	However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England, he said.
2	Capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that Welsh patients dont receive a worse service than patients over the border. Health analyst Tony Beddow, from the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care, called the new targets reasonably impressive.
2	On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced £264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.
2	Ms Hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year.
2	We are turning the corner on long waits in Wales.
2	Now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again, she said.
2	She added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant.
2	But let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in Wales that are waiting far too long. Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Plaid Cymru health spokesman said: Its exactly the same target she set in 1999, with the qualification that its dependent on a second offer.
2	Its a failed target, from a failed minister.
2	.
2	with a failed policy. For the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams called the new target hugely unambitious.
2	It leaves patients in Wales still waiting two years before theyre treated. Conservative health spokesman Jonathan Morgan said: Were spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof.
2	The Audit Commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively, and thats quite a criticism. Meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in Wales has fallen by 9.8%.
2	Statistics to the end of November showed a decline since October from 785 to 708.
2	The number waiting over 12 months also fell from 7,613 to 6,630, or 12.9%.
2	Ms Hutt said they were excellent figures.
2	There are 305,775 people on a waiting list of some kind, down from 311,764 last month.
2	Tories plan migrant health checks Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.
2	A positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case.
2	Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS.
2	Labour said many tests were already done.
2	The Lib Dems warned both parties against pandering to prejudice.
2	The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching.
2	Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
2	Its very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys, he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme.
2	Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years.
2	Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad, said Mr Howard.
2	I dont think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem. But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants claims.
2	The proposals include: - People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a high incidence TB country will have to undergo a chest X-ray.
2	- People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health.
2	- They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to impose significant costs or demands on the NHS.
2	- The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds.
2	Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
2	There is already some screening in place.
2	Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected.
2	And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well. The government says the Tories are a bit late to the issue.
2	Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage.
2	Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives.
2	Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one. Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based.
2	In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status, she said.
2	MPs issued with Blackberry threat MPs will be thrown out of the Commons if they use Blackberries in the chamber Speaker Michael Martin has ruled.
2	The £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone, pager or to send e-mails.
2	The devices gained new prominence this week after Alastair Campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a Newsnight journalist.
2	Mr Martin revealed some MPs had been using their Blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces.
2	The use of electronic devices in the Commons chamber has long been frowned on.
2	The sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the Speaker or his deputies.
2	The Speaker chairs debates in the Commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the House.
2	He or she is always an MP chosen by colleagues who, once nominated, gives up all party political allegiances.
2	Wales must learn health lessons The new health minister for Wales says there are lessons to learn from England in tackling waiting lists.
2	Dr Brian Gibbons, on his first full day in the job after Jane Hutt was sacked, admitted big challenges but insisted the essentials were in place.
2	But both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats said Dr Gibbons needed to change policy.
2	Meanwhile Ms Hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were only 10% of the health agenda.
2	Dr Gibbons, who was a GP in Blaengwynfi, in the Upper Afan Valley, before becoming AM for Aberavon, said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after tremendous change and reform.
2	One of the biggest problems which had faced Ms Hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assemblys first health minister was the length of waiting lists in Wales.
2	In November the British Medical Association said NHS staff were weeping with despair as figures showed 311,000 people were waiting for treatment in Wales, up by 2,400 on the previous month.
2	In the same month lists in England were at their lowest for 17 years, with 856,600 people waiting for treatment.
2	Dr Gibbons told Radio Wales: There is no doubt that, in managing waiting lists, England has done a lot of very very useful work, and we do need to learn from that. But he said the NHS in Wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health, and a balanced view of priorities was important.
2	We do need a consistent across-the-board approach, recognising the patients experience of how they use the service is going to be, at the end of the day, the main test of how the service is working. He said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after tremendous change and reform.
2	Later, Dr Gibbons praised the work of Ms Hutt, saying he agreed with everything shes done to change the health service in Wales.
2	Dr Gibbons said he accepted there was a problem, but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor.
2	He also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out, the rest of the assembly governments health policy would be overshadowed.
2	Opposition members and some Labour MPs had long called for Ms Hutts removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times.
2	First Minister Rhodri Morgan told BBC Wales he had agreed with Ms Hutt in 2003 that she would not be health minister in the run-up to the 2007 elections.
2	Shes been doing the job for five years and eight months and, apart from Nye Bevan himself, (architect of the NHS), I dont think anybody has ever done the job for so long. Mr Morgan said he had only told Ms Hutt of the reshuffle on Monday morning, and said the NHS in Wales was Dr Gibbons baby now.
2	In response to Dr Gibbons comments, Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the assembly, said: It is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking Titanic. Kisrty Williams, for the Lib Dems, added: If the underlying policy is going to continue, then changing the minister will serve no purpose, other than to deflect flak from Labours MPs, she said.
2	Meanwhile Ms Hutt said she hoped that the people of Wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months Asked about waiting lists, she said that waiting times and lists were only 10% of the health agenda and that the Welsh Assembly Government had turned the corner on the issue.
2	UKIP candidate suspended Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.
2	John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election.
2	But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers.
2	UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views.
2	The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk.
2	Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to law-abiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade.
2	The document reportedly said: Were looking for the resurrection of the British Empire.
2	The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do. Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houstons reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.
2	He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the partys manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate.
2	He told BBC News: He appears to have said these things.
2	We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.
2	By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.
2	It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies. Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway. Peter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night.
2	He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken. He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party.
2	He added: I cant comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I havent seen the papers yet. End Bush denial Blair tells EU Tony Blair is urging European leaders to wake up from their state of denial over President Bushs re-election.
2	America has spoken.
2	The rest of the world should listen, the prime minister said in an interview with The Times newspaper, published on Friday.
2	Mr Blair is at a summit in Brussels, where Iraq and European justice and immigration plans are on the agenda.
2	French President Jacques Chirac reacted to his warning by saying Europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity.
2	Mr Blair has probably been closer to President Bush than any other European leader.
2	He said some people were in a sort of state of denial about the US election result but predicted a more receptive mood would emerge soon.
2	America needed to listen to the world too, he said.
2	The fact is that President Bush is there for four years.
2	He is there because the American people have chosen him, he argued.
2	He also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together.
2	Britain was uniquely placed to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the US, he suggested.
2	He admitted he had gone to bed at 2230GMT, well before the American polls closed, thinking Mr Kerry might have won.
2	He woke up at 0530GMT to discover Mr Bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result.
2	His words about President Bush met a cool reception from Jacques Chirac.
2	The French president told reporters: Europe today has more than ever the need, the necessity, to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity.
2	That is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever. Mr Chirac will miss an address to the summit from Iraqi interim leader Iyad Allawi, who this week criticised nations which took a spectator role to Iraqs reconstruction.
2	Mr Chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the United Arab Emirates late leader and says he would be happy to meet Mr Allawi.
2	He also signed a communiqu&#233; stressing the EUs commitment to securing a stable and unified Iraq.
2	The EU also confirmed a new $21m aid package.
2	The communiqu&#233; congratulated President Bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations.
2	The summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline European asylum and immigration decisions.
2	Mr Blair recently said the UK would only participate in EU-wide measures where it was in UK interests but the Tories say he is surrendering a key veto.
2	The meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in Lisbon in 2000 to make Europe more competitive.
2	Brown to outline presidency goals Next year will be make or break for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.
2	The chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005.
2	They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations.
2	Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.
2	He also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria.
2	The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue.
2	He told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries. His proposals were effectively a new Marshall Plan for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year.
2	Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued.
2	The European Unions Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.
2	Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years.
2	But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally.
2	That is why next year is a test, he said.
2	If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results. The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Browns speech on Wednesday.
2	Cafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty.
2	Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption.
2	Oxfams Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels.
2	The charitys director, Barbara Stocking, said: 2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure. The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.
2	But 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable.
2	Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a scar on the worlds conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic.
2	But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing guff about scars on the world.
2	It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added.
2	Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005.
2	Instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said.
2	Theres no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has, added Mr Duncan.
2	Brown shrugs off economy fears Gordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.
2	In an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met.
2	The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK industrial history but denied he was gloating.
2	But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown Sir Wastealot.
2	The shadow chancellor said Mr Browns golden rule had turned to dross in his hands and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn.
2	Mr Letwin told MPs: The tide is going out on the chancellors credibility.
2	He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayers money. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.
2	He said: Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency.
2	There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt.
2	But they have not been confronted. Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dems call to open up the governments books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers.
2	Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking.
2	BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.
2	Mr Browns insistence he was not gloating was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson.
2	In his speech, he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election.
2	It includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father.
2	He also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007.
2	And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their parents were at work.
2	Taken together, the measures would create a welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history, said Mr Brown.
2	He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance.
2	In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, the chancellor said he was providing an extra £1bn for local councils.
2	The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.
2	Mr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt low and sustainable - both in this economic cycle and the next.
2	Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in Marchs budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics.
2	Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget.
2	Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Mr Brown forecast.
2	He also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism.
2	Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation.
2	But there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working.
2	Simon Sweetman, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: The proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers. UK troops on Ivory Coast standby Downing Street has confirmed British troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred UK citizens from Ivory Coast.
2	The news came as it emerged France had begun evacuating its hostages after days of anti-French demonstrations.
2	Trouble flared after nine French peacekeepers were killed and President Jacques Chirac ordered the destruction of the Ivory Coasts air force.
2	A company of 100-120 UK troops is understood to have been put on standby.
2	They are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon.
2	Prime Minister Tony Blairs official spokesman said: There are British nationals in Ivory Coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further, but thats all I can say at this stage. He added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary.
2	France has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in Ivory Coast - a former colony - after President Laurent Gbagbo broke an 18-month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine French soldiers.
2	The decision to destroy the African nations small air force prompted riots against French and other foreign nationals.
2	The Spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.
2	Blair told to double overseas aid Tony Blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries debt and double aid.
2	Some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, Oxfam says in a report, Paying the Price.
2	The call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the G8 of top industrialised nations.
2	As rich countries get richer, theyre giving less and less.
2	This scandal must stop, Oxfams Barbara Stocking said.
2	The worlds poorest children are paying for rich countries policies in aid and debt with their lives.
2	2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure, the charitys director added.
2	The report said: For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity. It also points out that in 1970 the G8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.
2	But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.
2	It argues that the price of not investing in poor countries sustainable development will be felt across the world.
2	The report said: Global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security.
2	Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders.
2	Poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest.
2	New threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities.
2	Criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak. Both the prime minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty.
2	Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a scar on the worlds conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic.
2	Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the worlds poor nations.
2	A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: The government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013.
2	If Britains proposal for an International Finance Facility were adopted, the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier, by 2008-09.
2	These additional resources will be used to increase UK bilateral aid to Africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on HIV/Aids related work over the next three years. Peace demo appeal rejected Peace protestors have lost a landmark appeal over police actions in stopping an anti-war demonstration days after the start of the Iraq war.
2	They had appealed against a High Court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near RAF Fairford, Glos, in 2003.
2	The police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case.
2	Sitting on Wednesday, three Appeal Court judges dismissed both appeals.
2	They were challenging decisions by two judges in the High Court in February this year.
2	It followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to RAF Fairford and forced to return to London under police escort.
2	The demonstrators appealed against a finding by Lord Justice May and Mr Justice Harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away.
2	The police were urging Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices Clarke and Rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors human rights by detaining them in the coaches.
2	Craig Mackey, assistant chief constable of Gloucestershire Police, said: We have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence. He said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields.
2	Given these circumstances, and the fact that RAF Fairford, and other military installations in the UK, had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident, the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches.
2	From day one we have vigorously defended this decision, which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at RAF Fairford. Fairford Coach Action, representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions, say they are prepared to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.
2	Their action is supported by Amnesty International and Liberty.
2	Retirement age could be scrapped The myth that ageing is a barrier to contributing to society needs to be exploded, the work and pensions minister has said.
2	This was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, Alan Johnson said.
2	It was also committed to stamping out age discrimination and would outlaw it, he told a conference on ageing.
2	All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.
2	Mr Johnson told Age Concerns Age Agenda in London the government was seriously considering introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions.
2	This idea has been adopted by the Lib Dems as policy, while the Tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions.
2	Mr Johnsons speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the countrys pension system.
2	This would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women, he said.
2	Speaking at the London conference he said: Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination.
2	The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were increasingly consigned to the past.
2	Were sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and were giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously.
2	And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded.
2	Mr Johnson said his department had a long-term aspiration of moving towards an 80% employment rate.
2	This would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force, he said.
2	Jowell rejects Las Vegas jibe The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.
2	She told the Guardian newspaper there would be no Las Vegas-style super-casinos, as rumoured in the press.
2	Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes a pile of pants.
2	The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4.
2	You look at some of the people who are involved... they arent in there to regenerate Blackpool.
2	They are in it to fill their boots, Mr Pound told the Today programme.
2	I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here.
2	And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti, he said.
2	Ms Jowell complained of the scale of misrepresentation in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched.
2	The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to protect children and the vulnerable in a swiftly changing sector.
2	Ms Jowell insisted: We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing. And continued: We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world.
2	I intend to keep it that way. Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday.
2	In prime ministers questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.
2	Ban on hunting comes into force Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.
2	The law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force.
2	Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.
2	He said police would challenge the one of two isolated hunts which are threatening to break the law.
2	But Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations.
2	The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements.
2	You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one, he said.
2	The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law.
2	He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police in the near future to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions.
2	He has rejected a blanket policy of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality.
2	John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices.
2	He said police had acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences.
2	The Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend.
2	Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.
2	As well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to flush out foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them.
2	We are not going away.
2	We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again, hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said.
2	But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about.
2	He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting.
2	Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting, he said.
2	Blair says UK tsunami aid to soar Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.
2	The prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in Egypt.
2	Mr Blair insisted he had been intimately involved in all decisions at all times despite being abroad.
2	He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead.
2	The Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing.
2	Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: I dont think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.
2	I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives. The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the £50m given by the government so far only six or seven million had been spent.
2	It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in.
2	My estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds.
2	So we will far and away more than match the generosity of the British people, he said.
2	Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery.
2	As you can see unfortunately I am still looking the same as I always did, he joked.
2	The prime minister took personal charge of the UKs response on Tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since Boxing Day.
2	He also spoke on the telephone to US President George Bush, and the presidents of Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
2	Chancellor Gordon Brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.
2	Mr Brown, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, says he has been in intensive talks with other G8 finance ministers.
2	Germany proposed a freeze last week and Canada has begun its own moratorium.
2	The chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $3bn (£1.58bn) in repayments.
2	Tory leader Michael Howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been playing catch-up with public donations.
2	Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is to visit Thailand and Indonesia this week.
2	During his trip, Mr Straw will represent the G8 at the international conference called in Jakarta, Indonesia on Thursday.
2	On Friday, he will visit the Thai beach resort of Phuket, where British families are still searching for relatives.
2	International Development Secretary Hilary Benn will also visit Aceh in Indonesia, as well as Sri Lanka.
2	The British public has now pledged £76m in aid with emergency supplies from the British government starting to arrive in the region on three RAF flights in a joint operation with Scandinavian countries.
2	Two ships - the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Diligence and frigate HMS Chatham - have arrived in the disaster area.
2	A second Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, the Bayleaf, is also being sent.
2	UK charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.
2	- A BBC News Special: Asia Remembered, including the three-minutes silence, will be shown on BBC One and BBC News 24 from 1130 to 1215 GMT on Wednesday.
2	Straw attacked on China arms Moves to lift the European Unions ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.
2	The 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of Chinas crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
2	UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban.
2	But Human Rights Watch says the EU is putting commerce above abuse concerns.
2	In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet.
2	Germany and France have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted.
2	Britain has been more cautious but Mr Straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite US objections.
2	He expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics.
2	Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square.
2	There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for. Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.
2	The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4s World At One.
2	In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said.
2	And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code.
2	The code of conduct is much more effective, its a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China, he said.
2	Mr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten.
2	The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said.
2	Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries.
2	Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the move would be profoundly wrong.
2	The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban.
2	Mr Ancram argued: What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong. Mr Straws China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers.
2	He will meet Chinese counterpart Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries, Hong Kong and Chinas part in the talks on North Korea.
2	Defiant hunts put ban to the test Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.
2	The Countryside Alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal, but vowed to stay within the law.
2	Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal.
2	One anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in Kent.
2	The man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the East Kent Hunt, near Ashford.
2	In Wiltshire, police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs.
2	The group, from South Wales and Ireland, have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.
2	It is believed more than 270 hunts went out on Saturday, just one day after the ban came in.
2	They were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country, with actor Jeremy Irons and former minister Kate Hoey among the supporters.
2	Anti-hunt groups - such as the League Against Cruel Sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.
2	Mike Hobday, from the league, said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police.
2	Our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law, many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting.
2	However, we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across Britain. BBC correspondent Simon Hall at Postbridge on Dartmoor in the West Country said 2,000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.
2	And the BBCs Sarah Mukherjee, with the Beaufort Hunt in Badminton, Gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback.
2	Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules.
2	And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.
2	Before riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned. Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers.
2	The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was impossibly difficult to determine and open to different interpretations.
2	Chief executive Simon Hart said: There has been hunting in England for 700 years.
2	This [ban] may take two or three years, perhaps two or three months, to unpick.
2	It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service, as broadcasters say. Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed.
2	Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts.
2	The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law.
2	He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police in the near future to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.
2	EU fraud clampdown urged EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UKs public spending watchdog has said.
2	The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud.
2	It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts.
2	The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud.
2	It said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent.
2	The report said: Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis.
2	As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources. It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth £38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002.
2	At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth £808m to 8,177 cases worth £644m.
2	Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency.
2	Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community, he said.
2	Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that theyre doing everything possible to weed out improper spending.
2	The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management. A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAOs assessment of fraud reporting.
2	The quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state, and there is room for improvement, spokesman Jorg Wojahn said.
2	He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud.
2	Straw praises Kashmir moves The UK has welcomed the decision by India and Pakistan to open a bus link across the ceasefire line dividing the disputed region of Kashmir.
2	Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, touring South East Asian countries, praised the spirit of cooperation in achieving the breakthrough.
2	Media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process.
2	Mr Straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to Kashmiris.
2	The bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in Islamabad on Wednesday.
2	Kashmiri politicians on both sides of the Line of Control which divides the region welcomed the move.
2	In a statement, Mr Straw said the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades.
2	This will make a real difference to the lives of Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control, he said.
2	I warmly applaud the efforts of both India and Pakistan to make this happen.
2	This spirit of cooperation will, I hope, lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region. On Thursday Mr Straw was in India visiting Sikhisms holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar where he tried his hand at making Indian bread or roti.
2	He is due to take part in talks with the Indian government on Friday.
2	A second bus service linking the Pakistani city of Lahore with Amritsar in India was also announced as well as a rail link between Rajasthan state and Pakistans Sindh province.
2	Both sides agreed to begin talks on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and also said they planned to reopen their respective consulates in Karachi and Mumbai (Bombay).
2	The mountainous region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers for more than 50 years.
2	UK helps raped Rwandan women Britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the Rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with HIV/Aids.
2	An estimated 25,000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide.
2	About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic Hutu leader.
2	The five-year Department for International Development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.
2	The plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time.
2	It was overshadowed by Rwandas emergence from the 100 days of slaughter, during which time the mass killings took place, and the womens fate was largely a taboo subject.
2	But many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but, in many cases, orphans too.
2	As the women die, the number of Rwandas orphans rises.
2	Until recently, very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment.
2	That is now starting to change.
2	This funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2,500 women.
2	Mary Kayitesi Blewitt, founder of the Survivors Fund (SURF), one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled, said it was a recognition, before it was too late, that the survivors should be a priority for help.
2	Howard denies split over ID cards Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.
2	The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a collective view after holding a good discussion, but admitted it was not an easy issue.
2	He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration.
2	The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.
2	Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme.
2	Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo.
2	But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans stink.
2	He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would set out the position very clearly when he stands up to debate the matter next week.
2	Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives.
2	He added: When the police say that you have to take them seriously.
2	He acknowledged there were good libertarian arguments against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the conflicting interests before reaching its decision.
2	I dont pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken. He also denied he was afraid of looking soft on the issue, compared to Labour.
2	The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.
2	Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary.
2	But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.
2	They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them.
2	And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether peoples privacy would be properly protected.
2	It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect, a spokesman said.
2	Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and deeply flawed.
2	He said: This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues concerns over ID cards. The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists.
2	What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped.
2	If they havent [ID cards] they are going to be detained. Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a regressive step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.
2	He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britains ethnic minorities being stopped by police.
2	EU referendum question unveiled The question to be asked in the referendum on the EU Constitution has been unveiled by the government.
2	It will be: Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union? The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote in the referendum, expected in 2006.
2	Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU.
2	If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe, said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a yes vote.
2	Patriots by definition wanted the UK to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad, Mr Straw said.
2	Our role as a leading member of the EU is a crucial part of securing that. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question seems straightforward.
2	But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as two separate issues.
2	Despite this underhand trick, the referendum bill stood no chance of becoming law before the election, he added.
2	This is Tony Blairs cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on Europe he knows he cannot win. Neil OBrien, director of anti-constitution group Vote No, said: The reality is that the government doesnt want to discuss the EU constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business. The UK Independence Party said: If the government believes that a No vote would mean that we should leave the European Union, they should just ask us if we want to leave the EU.
2	Then we can be out of it and better off much sooner. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year.
2	He told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: The sooner we get on with this, the better. He said the question sounded very neutral and balanced, adding it would enable the argument to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides.
2	Green MEP Caroline Lucas welcomed Tony Blairs courage in keeping his word on holding a referendum.
2	But she added: This treaty is a flawed document that will make the EU less accountable, less sustainable, and less just. Mr Blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in Rome in November, but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum.
2	That promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties.
2	Jack Straw, who argues the constitution reflected a British vision for Europe and gives national governments a stronger grip, has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006.
2	But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Blair refused to be pinned down to that date, saying Britain would hold a poll some time in 2006 but when, I dont know.
2	The paper said the prime minister claimed ignorance of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.
2	Malik rejects all-black MP lists A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labours most senior Asians.
2	Shahid Malik, who is on Labours ruling NEC, accepted peoples frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities.
2	Just 13 of Britains 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added.
2	Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists.
2	That came after it emerged that one of Britains most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.
2	Mr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups.
2	For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates.
2	If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way, he said.
2	He added: It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didnt have a minority candidate. Appearing on BBC Radio 4s Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.
2	But he argued: I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they arent doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective. Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat.
2	That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as painful.
2	I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasnt worked, she said.
2	The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people. On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was ambitious to improve black and Asian representation.
2	We havent ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this, he said.
2	MP attacked by muggers in Kenya An MP has had more than £600 and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in Kenya.
2	Quentin Davies, the MP for Grantham and Stamford, was attacked in a notoriously dangerous park in the capital, Nairobi.
2	He was not hurt in the mugging on Saturday evening.
2	Several people are being questioned over the attack.
2	He was in Kenya before travelling to Sudan with the Parliamentary committee.
2	Local police were said to be surprised he was in the area.
2	Mr Davies, 60, said the mugging occurred 100 yards from the Nairobi Serena Hotel and equally close to the Anglican Cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk.
2	He said in a statement: It was a frightening experience.
2	Six men managed to steal up on me and grab me from behind.
2	I knew I had to stay very calm and passive - you cannot fight six men.
2	He had to spend an extra 24 hours in Nairobi before rejoining the rest of the House of Commons International Development Committee in Dafur after the mugging.
2	Naturally, I was afraid they would use a knife or gun, though they never produced any weapon, he said.
2	Two of them held me from behind and two others held my legs and another one expertly rifled all my pockets. Candidate resigns over BNP link A prospective candidate for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) has resigned after admitting a brief attachment to the British National Party(BNP).
2	Nicholas Betts-Green, who had been selected to fight the Suffolk Coastal seat, quit after reports in a newspaper that he attended a BNP meeting.
2	The former teacher confirmed he had attended the meeting but said that was the only contact he had with the group.
2	Mr Betts-Green resigned after being questioned by the partys leadership.
2	A UKIP spokesman said Mr Betts-Greens resignation followed disclosures in the East Anglian Daily Times last month about his attendance at a BNP meeting.
2	He did once attend a BNP meeting.
2	He did not like what he saw and heard and will take no further part of it, the spokesman added.
2	A meeting of Suffolk Coastal UKIP members is due to be held next week to discuss a replacement.
2	Mr Betts-Green, of Woodbridge, Suffolk, has also resigned as UKIPs branch chairman.
2	Nuclear dumpsite plan attacked Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded deeply irresponsible by the Liberal Democrats.
2	The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK.
2	The cash raised will go towards the UKs nuclear clean-up programme.
2	But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a nuclear dumpsite.
2	Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back.
2	In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard.
2	Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK.
2	At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums.
2	In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries.
2	And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.
2	Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to £680m for Britains nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency.
2	But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats.
2	Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times.
2	But now our worst fears have been confirmed.
2	Once again Britains environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI.
2	This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the £48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites.
2	The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite.
2	The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britains neck. Labour accused of broken pledge Labour has already broken its pre-election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card, the Tories have claimed.
2	Home Secretary Charles Clarke has been quoted as telling Labour members he wants more migrants to come to the UK.
2	Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said the comments were at odds with Tony Blairs prediction of a net cut in immigration.
2	But Mr Clarke accused him of trying to score cheap political points by muddling immigration with asylum.
2	Londons Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny.
2	Thats not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country, he said.
2	We want more migration, more people come to study and to work.
2	We want more people coming to look for refuge. Mr Blairs was asked last Wednesday if the governments new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration.
2	The prime minister told MPs: The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle], the numbers will probably fall. On Monday, Dr Fox told reporters: The prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week.
2	The Labour Party election pledges, even when they are so incredibly vague, do not even last four days. The Tories want quotas for economic migrants and refugees and on Tuesday will outline more details of their plans for health checks on migrants.
2	Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack.
2	This is simply a scurrilous attempt by the Tories to score cheap political points, he said.
2	The Tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum. Mr Clarke said he had made clear the UK would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system.
2	And only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted.
2	Under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall, he added.
2	Earlier, Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about Tory policies and then attacking the lies.
2	He told BBC Radio: If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all. The latest pre-election spats come after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a hard right agenda which would take Britain backwards.

2	Labour trio had vote-rig factory Three Labour councillors in Birmingham were caught operating a vote-rigging factory, an Election Court has heard.
2	Police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in June 2004, the hearing was told.
2	The votes were later counted towards that months English local elections.
2	The men, elected to the Aston ward, deny collecting votes fraudulently.
2	The judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny.
2	Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election.
2	The special Election Court, the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging, opened in Birmingham last month.
2	The case against Muhammad Afzal, Mohammed Islam and Mohammed Kazi is being brought by local Liberal Democrat supporters.
2	They claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 June election.
2	Ravi Sukul, counsel for the petitioners, accused the three men of being deeply involved in illegal practices.
2	Witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office, which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off Birch Road East, the court was told.
2	The police were alerted and called to the premises.
2	Mr Sukul said: When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present.
2	Hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table. The police officers left the warehouse, but were later ordered back to seize the documents.
2	When the officers left, all the envelopes and papers were scattered, Mr Sukul said.
2	(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed.
2	The house was in order. Interrupting Mr Sukul in his opening, Mr Mawrey said: What you are saying is, these men were operating a vote-forging factory on an industrial estate. The court heard how documents were taken by police to the elections office next morning, where they were mixed in with other ballots.
2	The case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other Birmingham councillors in the Bordesley Green ward, claims which are denied.
2	Mr Mawrey is due to deliver a judgment in their case once the Aston petition has been heard.
2	Mr Afzal, Mr Islam and Mr Kazi deny conspiring to commit election fraud to deceive the returning officer.
2	The case continues.
2	Blair returns from peace mission Prime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.
2	Mr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.
2	He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March.
2	Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week.
2	The Israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend.
2	Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so.
2	He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.
2	The BBCs Paul Reynolds says the London conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is expected to win the Palestinian presidential election on 9 January.
2	At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit.
2	He added: Your endeavour to hold a conference in London is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose. In an interview with the BBCs political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be tough, but at least we have got the first step.
2	Mr Blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the Israelis, but said the Israelis were entitled to expect Palestinians to give up terrorism.
2	He argued that Mr Sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from Gaza had to be part of the peace process, not the end of it.
2	Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not seen the slightest step the Palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged Palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts.
2	Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city.
2	He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence.
2	He also flew to Basra in southern Iraq where British forces are stationed.
2	Galloway plea for hostage release Ex-Labour MP George Galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker Margaret Hassan, kidnapped in Iraq.
2	Mrs Hassan, 59, who led Care International operations in Iraq, was abducted in Baghdad on 19 October.
2	Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on Iraq.
2	He denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the Al-Jazeera Arabic television channel.
2	Speaking in London on Saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party, the Respect Coalition, he said: I have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations.
2	But this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions.
2	I am prepared to do anything I can to help save her life. A spokesman later said Mr Galloway had friends in common with Ms Hassan, who he described as a prominent anti-war activist, and that he was willing to do anything - go to Iraq or be an intermediary or anything thats necessary.
2	Since her abduction, several videos of Mrs Hassan have been broadcast by Al-Jazeera.
2	The latest footage showed Mrs Hassan asking for British troops to be pulled out of Iraq.
2	She also urged Care International, the aid agency she works for, to close its office in Baghdad, and appealed for Iraqi women prisoners to be freed.
2	Care has since closed down all its operations in Iraq.
2	Guantanamo four questioned The four Britons freed from US custody in Guantanamo Bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative.
2	Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi and Richard Belmar were held for three years, accused of al-Qaeda links.
2	Mr Beggs father, Azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was a hero.
2	The men are being held at Londons Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers.
2	But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station.
2	Before being driven by police from Birmingham to London, Azmat Begg said he was concerned for his son Moazzams mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug.
2	As Azmat Begg arrived at the London police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements.
2	Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK.
2	But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was absolutely inadmissible in UK courts.
2	In an interview with the Independent, Sir John said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK.
2	He told the newspaper: If an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence.
2	The options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged.
2	If not they will be released as soon as possible. The men have been allowed to meet their lawyers.
2	Louise Christian said that after being tortured and abused at Guantanamo Bay, the mens arrest was unfair and inappropriate.
2	She told BBC News she remained very concerned about their psychological state.
2	Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them.
2	Washington has claimed all four were enemy combatants who trained at camps run by al-Qaeda.
2	The Pentagon says they were freed after the UK government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies.
2	The detainees were immediately arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 when they landed at RAF Northolt, west London, on Tuesday.
2	Massoud Shadjareh, from the Muslim Safety Forum, said: What sort of homecoming is this? They are innocent people. The Muslim Council of Britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help.
2	We want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family, said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the council.
2	Minister defends hunting ban law The law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales is enforceable and very clear, Alun Michael has said.
2	The rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not.
2	Some 270 hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds.
2	But anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts.
2	Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting.
2	People had turned out to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law, he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed legally as far as he was aware.
2	Although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal.
2	Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4s Today Programme: There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.
2	The reality is that the law is very clear.
2	You cant chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer.
2	If people do so and pretend theyre not its going to become very clear.
2	You cant hunt accidentally. Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities.
2	He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their childrens future than hunting.
2	But the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen.
2	Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken.
2	There were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in Wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the Hunting Act.
2	They have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.
2	But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes.
2	If people tried to run circles around this law the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said.
2	Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police.
2	He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts.
2	But Mr Jackson, who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.
2	Clarke to unveil immigration plan New controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on Monday.
2	Home Secretary Charles Clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers.
2	Tony Blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no magic bullet.
2	The Tories say Labour is acting too late while the Lib Dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system.
2	The governments new five-year plan is designed to show how Labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election, expected to be held in May.
2	Ministers deny they have been spurred into action by Tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done.
2	Instead, they say the plans are part of an evolving process aimed at winning public confidence.
2	Mr Clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants families, and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants.
2	The prime minister on Sunday said immigration would be toughened up to ensure only those immigrants with skills the UK really needs will be granted work permits.
2	But he rejected the Tories call for a quota on economic migrants, saying no arbitrary figure could reflect the UKs needs.
2	Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4s Westminster Hour: We should cut the number or increase it depending on the countrys needs... The public are worried about this, they are worried rightly, because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system. But he defended the UKs current regime, saying all systems around the world were subject to abuse.
2	Tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work, argued Mr Blair.
2	He said: We will not be... pretending there is some simple easy way of processing Britains asylum seekers in some other country, because no such other country exists. Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis said the government had failed to remove 250,000 failed asylum seekers from the UK and limits on economic migrants had been a shambles.
2	What we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from the government after eight years of failure, he said.
2	Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said Labour was right to reject the Tories idea of quotas on asylum.
2	But he said it was yet to be seen if Mr Clarke could deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.
2	Mayor will not retract Nazi jibe London mayor Ken Livingstone has again refused to retract a Nazi insult made to a Jewish reporter.
2	Labours Mr Livingstone, who says he is standing by his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a concentration camp guard.
2	At his weekly press conference on Tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise.
2	He said to media representatives: If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong. The mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 Olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs, who arrived in London on Tuesday.
2	I think it is important that the IOC (International Olympic Committee) members realise that when we get the games... they have a mayor who is not going to panic, change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget, he said.
2	On Tuesday, the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly.
2	Two motions were passed by the London Assembly, which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayors activities, on Monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments.
2	The mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of examples of intrusion by journalists into his, and his familys private life.
2	I dont suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the Holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history.
2	But when reporters say to me Im only doing this because its my job... thats the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard.
2	We are responsible for our own choices in this life, I always have been and so have reporters. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England.
2	It has the power to suspended or bar him from office but Mr Livingstone said: There must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years.
2	I have never in response to any of that modified a policy I believed to be right or modified a position I believed to be right and I dont intend to now.
2	Because if I do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers. On tape Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking reporter Oliver Finegold if he is a German war criminal.
2	Mr Finegold replies: No, Im Jewish, I wasnt a German war criminal.
2	Im quite offended by that. The mayor then says: Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, arent you? Pakistani women must not hide Hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of Islam, President Musharraf of Pakistan has said during a visit to Britain.
2	He was speaking to the BBCs Newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the Pakistani community in Manchester.
2	My wife is travelling around.
2	She is very religious but she is very moderate, said General Musharraf.
2	It comes after Pakistans High Commissioner to Britain said some Pakistanis should integrate more.
2	Dr Maleeha Lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.
2	Gen Musharraf told the BBC: Some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong. The Pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe.
2	Yes, absolutely.
2	And I would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems, so therefore we can never address it in its totality, he said.
2	We are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic long-term context.
2	It is the political disputes and we need to resolve them, and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty.
2	This combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism. On Monday the Pakistani president met Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street, on his first official visit to London.
2	He is due to visit the Pakistani community in Manchester on Tuesday afternoon.
2	The Mirror newspaper said on Tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of Gen Musharrafs visit to Britain.
2	The paper said the document had been found in a London street by a member of the public.
2	It said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels, call signs and codes.
2	Speaking in London on Monday, Gen Musharraf said al-Qaeda was on the run in Pakistan.
2	But standing next to Mr Blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the core of what creates terrorists, what creates an extremist, militant environment which then leads on to terrorism.
2	That is the resolution of political disputes. Mr Blair said the two leaders had talked about Afghanistan, the wider war on terror, the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir.
2	We agreed that in Afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there, said Mr Blair.
2	In respect of Iraq, we agreed that whatever the issues of the past, the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that Iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state. Visa row mandarin made Sir John The top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.
2	Sir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting.
2	He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunketts ex-lovers nanny came to be fast-tracked.
2	The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Years list.
2	Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.
2	Both men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made.
2	The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.
2	The Liberal Democrats said it beggared belief he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalmes application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunketts office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department.
2	Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a collective failure of memory.
2	But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.
2	Downing Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: You have to look at their whole career. Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974.
2	He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment.
2	A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smiths honour: The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.
2	In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes. Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March.
2	Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively.
2	Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS.
2	Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr Tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.
2	Kilroy-Silk attacked with slurry Euro MP Robert Kilroy-Silk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester in Manchester.
2	The UK Independence Party member was arriving for a BBC radio show when the attacker emerged from behind a bush.
2	Fellow guest Ruth Kelly MP was also hit by the slurry.
2	Mr Kilroy-Silk said the man, who later disappeared, claimed he was doing it in the name of Islam.
2	In January, Mr Kilroy-Silk quit his BBC One show for remarks he made about Arabs, who he called suicide bombers.
2	Mr Kilroy-Silk had already been taken off air by BBC bosses for the comments, in which he also described Arabs as limb-amputators, women repressors.
2	The remarks prompted outrage among Muslim groups.
2	The slurry attack took place on Friday as Mr Kilroy-Silk and Ms Kelly, a Cabinet Office minister and Bolton West MP, arrived at Manchester High School for Girls for the recording of BBC Radio 4s Any Questions.
2	The police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived.
2	They are treating the incident as assault.
2	The programmes host, Jonathan Dimbleby, later told the audience the MEP had been covered from head to toe.
2	Mr Kilroy-Silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.
2	He told reporters he was very angry and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught.
2	He said the man shouted: Youve offended my religion, Im doing this in the name of Islam. As I started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car, Mr Kilroy-Silk said.
2	I was totally covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven.
2	It went all inside the car and splattered Ruth Kelly. A BBC spokesman said: He took his seat as Jonathan Dimbleby was introducing the show.
2	Fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have. Greater Manchester Police said people near Mr Kilroy-Silk had also been hit by the waste.
2	Officers took statements at the scene, but no arrests have been made.
2	Police say the suspect ran off after towards Wilmslow Road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red Vauxhall Corsa earlier.
2	The suspect is described as white, aged 30 to 40, with a ginger beard.
2	Police want to hear from anyone who has any information.
2	Mr Kilroy-Silk, an MEP for the East Midlands, resigned the UK Independence Party whip in the European Parliament in October, after criticising UKIP and stating his ambition to be leader.
2	However, he remains a member of the party.
2	He said on Friday he hoped to be elected party leader before Christmas.
2	I think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the General Election. But a UKIP spokesman said that would be impossible under the partys constitution, which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.
2	Petrol duties frozen, Brown says Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the Commons on Thursday.
2	Mr Brown told the House that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments.
2	But this financial year, because of volatility in the oil market, he said the duty would be frozen.
2	During 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution.
2	He said: It is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.
2	But this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market I propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties. The RAC welcomed the news, calling it an early Christmas present for motorists.
2	But the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol.
2	Environmental group Transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists.
2	We are concerned that although Britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action, said a spokesman.
2	In 2000 the Peoples Fuel Lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after Mr Brown threatened to raise fuel taxes.
2	The chancellor did not raise duty that year, but despite threats of more protests in 2003, he added 1.28p per litre.
2	Howard unveils election platform The Conservatives would stand up for the forgotten majority, Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.
2	The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values.
2	In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people.
2	Labour says the document offers only a return to a failed Tory past.
2	The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.
2	Campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006.
2	Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster.
2	Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto.
2	Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.
2	In a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the forgotten majority made up the backbone of Britain.
2	They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities.
2	He says in the manifesto foreword: They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair. Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue down the path of ever rising taxes.
2	He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall bureaucrats.
2	And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder.
2	The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called human rights have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder, he says.
2	Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans.
2	Mr Howard told BBC News: Im determined to lower taxes but Im also determined not to make any promises I cant keep. The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said.
2	He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour.
2	Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain.
2	It had nothing to do with putting clear blue water between himself and his opponents.
2	Labours election slogan will be: Britains working, dont let the Tories wreck it again.
2	Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of launching Thatcherism in instalments while Labour helped the hard working majority of families.
2	Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September.
2	The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust, he said.
2	Lawyer attacks anti-terror laws A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the governments anti-terror laws says the current system is giving Britain a bad name.
2	Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful.
2	He was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists.
2	Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign.
2	Mr MacDonald told BBC News: The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion.
2	The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community.
2	I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally.
2	Under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial.
2	But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury.
2	My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations.
2	As far as Im concerned, the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this. he added.
2	The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday.
2	According to the Independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Nicol QC, Manjit Singh Gill QC, Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare.
2	They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects.
2	Mr MacDonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow.
2	But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4s Today programme that more lawyers may go.
2	I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning, he said.
2	They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights. Helena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the Special Advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees.
2	When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review, she said.
2	Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law. Turkey deal to help world peace A deal bringing Turkey a step closer to EU membership is of fundamental importance to the peace and security of the world, Tony Blair has said.
2	The deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were wrong, Mr Blair said.
2	It represented the achievement of an historic British objective, he added.
2	Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was anti-Islamic.
2	Turkeys involvement with the EU would provide an invaluable bridge between Europe and the rest of the world, Mr Howard added.
2	But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey.
2	Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea.
2	He insisted that the Turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records.
2	The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus.
2	It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership.
2	The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a red line.
2	It could take up to 15 years before Turkey is able to join, and entry cannot be guaranteed.
2	If it joins, Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens.
2	The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with Croatia in April 2005.
2	However, talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
2	Protect whistleblowers, TUC says The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said.
2	It said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 safety whistleblowers had lost their jobs since 1999.
2	Some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions, it said.
2	The Health and Safety Executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer.
2	The TUC figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue.
2	Safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond, claimed the union organisation.
2	General secretary Brendan Barber said: It shouldnt be a firing offence to object to unsafe work.
2	Workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety. Mr Barber, who said the problem is far worse than official statistics show, called for a legal system that protects safety whistleblowers.
2	He added that workers who are not in a union, as well as casual and migrant workers, stand little chance of redress. Rory O Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win.
2	Death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century.
2	It would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect. The TUC has called on the government to appoint roving safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections.
2	The Health and Safety Executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer, with more worker involvement.
2	Kinnock to urge reform in Lords Neil Kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the House of Lords will allow him to help achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform. On the BBCs Breakfast with Frost it was put to Mr Kinnock that he had once referred to Lords members as brigands, muggers, bribers and gangsters.
2	But the outgoing European Commissioner said his comments - made some 26 years ago - needed to be put in context.
2	He said advocates for reform needed to be inside the Lords to vote for it.
2	It was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the Lords and people there willing to vote for it. Mr Kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the British Council.
2	History demonstrates that its immensely useful for the British Council to have its chairman in the House of Lords and that was a conclusive factor. Mr Kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite a long time because he had long had reservations about the Lords.
2	But he added: The process of reform has developed substantially but not sufficiently, and consequently I did take all these factors into consideration because its not a decision to be made glibly. The former Labour leader said he would probably take the title of Lord Kinnock of Bedwellty - his first constituency for which he was selected in 1969.
2	McConnell details Scots wave toll At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list, the first minister has told MSPs.
2	The figures came out during a statement by Jack McConnell to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday.
2	He formally expressed Scotlands sympathy for the victims of the Indian Ocean tidal wave which killed 150,000.
2	Mr McConnell went on to promise that Scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort.
2	He said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.
2	Mr McConnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better.
2	He said he was proud of the generous response of people in Scotland to the disaster appeal, which is expected soon to top £20m.
2	The first minister also praised Scottish Water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone.
2	The Scottish Executive has seconded 11 staff to the aid agencies.
2	But he said Scotland was in it for the long term with help planned for fishing communities, for childrens services, and for the aid charities.
2	He said 2005 must be the year that Scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world, whether in Asia or in Africa.
2	Mr McConnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the Make Poverty History campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities, trade unions and churches in the run-up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July.
2	Edinburgh architect, Dominic Stephenson, became the first Scot to be confirmed as a victim of the Asian tsunami.
2	The 27-year-old was holidaying on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi with Eileen Lee, 24.
2	She is still missing.
2	Police urge pub closure power New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told MPs.
2	Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords.
2	Mr Foxs comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock.
2	He rejected critics calls for the law change to be delayed.
2	Instead, the new Licensing Act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned, he argued.
2	Acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the Commons home affairs select committee.
2	After the meeting, Mr Fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact.
2	If its 12.30 on a Saturday morning and you close for 24 hours theres not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldnt open on Sunday anyway.
2	This is about getting through to the management that they cant run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions. Under Acpos proposal, the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority.
2	The new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods.
2	Mr Fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself.
2	Its making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse, and the strategic planning process has been less than useless, he said.
2	Mr Fox said the new laws, due to start being phased in next month, could help if food outlets, public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers.
2	Staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there, if the premises are properly managed and people arent being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street, he said.
2	We have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event.
2	We have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this. Acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs.
2	Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing.
2	The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs, councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems.
2	Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes.
2	It was the status quo, not the new laws, which were causing current binge drinking problems, she told BBC Twos Newsnight.
2	Leaked documents have suggested ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett branded new opening hours as a leap in the dark.
2	But Ms Jowell insisted his concerns had been met.
2	The polices job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added.
2	Blunkett tells of love and pain David Blunkett has spoken of his love for married publisher Kimberly Quinn for the first time.
2	The home secretary described how it affected his friends and personal life, but said he was a great believer in personal responsibility.
2	Mr Blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to Mrs Quinns two-year-old son.
2	She denies he is Mr Blunketts.
2	The interview with BBC Radio Sheffield was made before allegations he fast-tracked a visa for Mrs Quinns nanny.
2	The allegations, which he has denied, are being investigated by Sir Alan Budd.
2	Mr Blunkett talked about how he fell in love - but that she resisted his desire to go public.
2	In an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son, he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences, even when they were painful.
2	Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio Sheffield: I fell in love with someone and they wouldnt go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story.
2	I tried for three years to make something work.
2	I havent spoken about it and I dont intend to.
2	Even in the biography thats being written about me Ive ensured that theres as little as possible. BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary.
2	Shadow home secretary David Davis says Mr Blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly.
2	Reports have claimed Mr Blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny Leoncia Casalmes wait.
2	The Home Office has said it would be up to Sir Alans inquiry to decide if any such meeting was relevant.
2	Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she hoped Mr Blunkett would survive in his job.
2	I work with him every day and I have always been surprised by how focused he is on the job in hand, on working to deal with things, she said.
2	She told BBC Ones Breakfast with Frost programme: He is just really down for the job and I hope he does (survive). Housing plans criticised by MPs Irreversible environmental damage will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east England, MPs have warned.
2	Sustainable communities were being promoted without a real understanding of what sustainable means, the Environmental Audit Committee said.
2	It said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed.
2	Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced.
2	He said: We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment. The report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low.
2	Regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax, and builders routinely flout them anyway, it said.
2	Financing for improving transport was around one-twentieth of what would be required.
2	The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescotts department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said.
2	Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee Peter Ainsworth MP, said: The governments housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial.
2	I accept the need to improve housing supply but, as things stand, the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers, with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser. Points raised in the report included: - No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence.
2	- The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasurys Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain.
2	- The government should consider a national spatial framework for England such as those already in place in Scotland and Wales.
2	- The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities.
2	- Measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes.
2	- The government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities.
2	Conservative local government spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said: There is now growing evidence that John Prescotts buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural England. MPs murder sentence concern Murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new MPs report.
2	The influential Commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer.
2	The MPs also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs.
2	They say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders.
2	Committee chairman John Denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse.
2	The committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor. At present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty.
2	But although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy.
2	In July this year Amanda Champions killer, James Ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge.
2	Amandas uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence. MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.
2	The measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after Mr Blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.
2	As a result, says the committee, the government may need to re-legislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced.
2	It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty.
2	The committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers.
2	Lord Woolfs Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime.
2	As a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.
2	Mr Denham believes the SGC should reconsider its proposals to reflect Parliaments wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence.
2	He said: We want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances. But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals.
2	He said: By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences.
2	We stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial. Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules.
2	There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the governments claim to be tough on crime, he said.
2	But Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten warned the MPs committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference.
2	The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, it is also different, he told BBC News.
2	No-one can define new hunt ban The new law banning hunting with dogs is so poorly drafted no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say.
2	The accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his farm.
2	Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting.
2	Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.
2	North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, Defra.
2	He had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the Hunting Act.
2	Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain.
2	The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free.
2	In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defras lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence.
2	Mr Opik said: Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act.
2	Now Defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting - chasing away which isnt even covered by the Act.
2	However, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals.
2	How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away? Tory MP Peter Luff, another co-chairman of Middle Way, said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence.
2	It is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law.
2	However, I seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating. Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: There is no confusion, it is a matter of simple common sense.
2	If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.
2	If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting. Hospital suspends no Welsh plan An English hospital has suspended plans to stop treating Welsh patients who have waited more than three months.
2	Hereford County Hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations.
2	GPs in Wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue.
2	But after talks with Powys Health Board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in January.
2	Hereford Hospital Trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients.
2	Shocked health officials in Powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals.
2	Andy Williams, chief executive of Powys Local Health Board, had said it was a totally unacceptable way to behave.
2	Mr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh-English issue, but said Hereford hospital was struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys.
2	He had told BBC Radio Wales: I have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients I am paying them to treat. But after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, Mr Williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure Welsh patients continued to be treated there.
2	He said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between England and Wales.
2	The target is 12 months for Welsh patients, but just three months in England.
2	The contract with the Powys health board was worth £7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients.
2	In a statement before the suspension of the idea, the Welsh Assembly Government said the situation was unacceptable.
2	But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate, said the assembly government.
2	Although we will be challenging Herefords decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients.
2	They will be contacted by their GPs in the next week. Earlier, David Rose, Chief Executive of Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, had said: It is with real regret that we have taken this step.
2	We want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to Powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service.
2	In 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want Powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital.
2	We appeal to Powys Local Health Board to allow Powys people to choose Hereford for their treatment. Tories pledge free sports lessons Children would be offered two hours free sports training a week by a future Tory government, the party has said.
2	The Club2School policy would provide up to £250m yearly for local sports clubs in the UK to deliver after-school sport.
2	The extra coaching would be funded by the National Lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school.
2	Shadow home secretary David Davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.
2	The plans would help tackle the fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world, he said.
2	Shadow sports minister Lord Moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy.
2	We aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the UK. The Tories say Labours plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed.
2	Government figures show that in England in 2002 only a third of schools at Key Stages 1, 3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at Key Stage 2, met that target.
2	The Tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities, only £41m had been spent.
2	But the Big Lottery Fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.
2	Faith schools citizenship warning Schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog.
2	Independent faith schools were singled out by Ofsted chief, David Bell, for not doing enough to promote the wider tenets of British society.
2	Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be intolerant of intolerance.
2	Diversity certainly must not mean segregated or separate, he said.
2	Mr Bells speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.
2	Badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by Mr Bell, and in a speech to the Hansard Society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values.
2	He highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 Muslim, 100 Evangelical Christian and 50 Jewish schools.
2	Mr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a common heritage and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion.
2	I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society, said Mr Bell.
2	The Ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to Muslim schools.
2	Many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony. Mr Bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were tricky issues.
2	But he argued that we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation.
2	I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships, said Mr Bell.
2	Ministers lose slopping out case The Scottish Executive has lost an appeal against an inmates compensation for being forced to slop out in prison.
2	Armed robber Robert Napier, 25, won £2,450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint, eczema, when slopping out at Barlinnie Prison.
2	Napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights.
2	On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.
2	The executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates.
2	More than 310 actions have already been raised in the Court of Session and sheriff courts in Scotland.
2	An executive spokesman said: We will study this judgement in detail.
2	Much has changed to address the issues raised in the Napier case, for example, slopping out has ended at Barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated.
2	Todays judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases. Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought £5,000.
2	He was awarded compensation last April after winning his case.
2	Executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should be beyond reasonable doubt.
2	This is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in Scotland.
2	However, civil litigation is settled on the test of a balance of probabilities.
2	Judge Lord Cullen, sitting with Lord Osborne and Lord Hamilton, ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard.
2	Napiers lawyer Tony Kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others.
2	Mr Kelly said: There are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out, overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by todays judgement. Scottish National Party Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill said that the slopping out case had been a fiasco from start to finish.
2	He said: Ministers were fully aware of the state of Scotlands jails.
2	Funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling I suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts.
2	A short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost. Escaped prisoner report ordered First Minister Jack McConnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded.
2	Michael Ferguson, 36, escaped after being allowed out of the high-security Carstairs unit.
2	The SNPs Nicola Sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave.
2	The Scottish Executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval.
2	An executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report.
2	Ministerial responsibility for Carstairs rests with Rhona Brankin, the deputy health minister.
2	Ms Brankin said: The first minister has called for a review of what has happened, we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this. Ms Sturgeon has written to Mr McConnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out.
2	She said questions must be answered about his escape, if the public is to be reassured about safety.
2	Police are still searching for Ferguson, who failed to return after a trip to East Kilbride on Monday.
2	The Scottish National Partys parliamentary leader argued that under the law, authorisation of Fergusons leave of absence would have come directly from ministers.
2	She said: The Scottish Executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of Mr Ferguson was a matter for Carstairs.
2	However, my understanding is that, under the mental health legislation, the decision to grant this patient - and any restricted patient - leave of absence, would have required direct and specific authorisation by Scottish ministers. She added: I have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact.
2	I have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on.
2	This is not an attempt to apportion blame, but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases. Police said Ferguson posed a danger to the public.
2	BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation.
2	He said: We understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for Michael Ferguson to be released unescorted from Carstairs.
2	The executive concedes that it is up to Scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it.
2	But at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised. Scottish Conservative leader, David McLetchie, said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen.
2	The executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers.
2	She said: Ministers were told of that, notified of it, but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off.
2	They do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision. Ferguson, who slashed a man in a doctors surgery in Coatbridge in 1994, had been out to see his fianc&#233;e Annabella Holmes, 47, whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in South Lanarkshire.
2	He is described as being 5ft 9ins tall, slim, with blond hair, blue eyes and a fair complexion.
2	Ferguson was wearing a black jacket, grey jeans, black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen.
2	He has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye.
2	Ms Holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of Ferguson since Monday.
2	Strathclyde Police asked anyone who spots Ferguson to contact Sergeant Keith McDonald on .
2	Chancellor rallies Labour voters Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry, telling supporters the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election.
2	The chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 May - will give a clear and fundamental choice between Labour investment and Conservative cuts.
2	Speaking at Labours spring conference in Gateshead, Mr Brown claimed the NHS was not safe in Conservative hands.
2	He said Tory plans to cut £35bn tax would cut deep into public service.
2	To a packed audience at Gatesheads Sage Centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country, he told activists.
2	Laying into the Conservatives record in government he said: I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, £3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.
2	Never again Tory boom and bust.
2	This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 £60bn more. Turning to the economy, the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.
2	He said after seven years Labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to the only party trusted with the economy.
2	It was now a party not just of employees, but of employers and managers, he said.
2	In the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly warm to Mr Brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.
2	He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the worlds poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of childrens centres and flexibility in maternity leave.
2	The prime minister is to take part later on Saturday in an interactive question and answer session, fielding queries sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labours attempt to engage the public in their campaign.
2	Councils must find Gypsy sites Ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers, amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments.
2	Councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by Gypsy communities on rural land.
2	More money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks, said housing minister Yvette Cooper.
2	In November, MPs urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop.
2	Ms Cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places.
2	That scheme has paid out £25m in four years, with £8m available for 2005.
2	There are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning Gypsy and traveller sites, said Ms Cooper.
2	Firstly, local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites.
2	And secondly, they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites.
2	The result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the Gypsies and travellers.
2	That is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites, as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment. Under the new regulations, expected to be in force in the spring, officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban.
2	Many MPs with rural constituencies, particularly in eastern England, have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers, saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.
2	Andrew Ryder, of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, said: We welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for Gypsies and travellers, so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored.
2	New accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers, as they often do.
2	Living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals, legal action and eviction is no ones idea of fun. In their November report, MPs from the committee scrutinising the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop.
2	Numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities, said the MPs.
2	In turn, the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents.
2	Two of the most controversial traveller sites - Cottenham in Cambridgeshire and Minety in Wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.
2	Plaid MPs cottage arson claim A Plaid Cymru MP believes UK security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on Welsh extremists.
2	It is 25 years since the start of 12 years of fire-bombings, attributed to a shadowy group known as Meibion Glyndwr.
2	Plaid Cymrus Elfyn Llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved, with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote.
2	Ex-Welsh Office Minister Lord Roberts of Conwy denied security services were involved.
2	In March this year, North Wales Police reopened the case, saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield DNA evidence.
2	Meibion Glyndwr - which means sons of Glyndwr - began burning property in December 1979 in protest at homes in rural Wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from England.
2	The group was linked to most of the 220 or so fire-bombing incidents stretching from the Llyn Peninsula to Pembrokeshire.
2	The campaign continued until the early 1990s.
2	Police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist.
2	Although one man, Sion Aubrey Roberts, was convicted in 1993 of sending letter bombs in the post, the arson cases remain unsolved.
2	As a solicitor, Elfyn Llwyd represented Welsh singer Bryn F&#244;n when he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the arson campaign.
2	F&#244;n was released without charge .
2	But now, as MP for Merionnydd Nant Conwy and Plaid Cymrus Parliamentary Leader, Mr Llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not Meibion Glyndwr.
2	He believes that elements of the British security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit Plaid Cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections.
2	The claim is made in an interview for BBC Wales Maniffesto programme to be shown on S4C on Sunday.
2	Mr Llwyd said that the sophistication of many of the devices used in the attacks compared to the crude nature of many others, suggests a degree of professionalism which could only have come from individuals who knew exactly what they were doing.
2	He said: What Im saying is that the role that they took wasnt the appropriate one, i.
2	e.
2	like an agent provocateur and perhaps interfering and creating a situation where it looked like it was the nationalists that were responsible. The programme also heard from Lord Roberts of Conwy, who was a Welsh Office minister at the time.
2	He denied that the security services played any improper role.
2	Mr Llwyds theory has also been questioned by Plaid Cymrus former President, Dafydd Wigley.
2	He accepted that the fires damaged Plaid Cymrus public image but believed that the security services had their hands full at the time with the IRA and animal rights activists.
2	- Maniffesto can be seen on S4C on Sunday, 12 December, at 1200 GMT.
2	Hatfield executives go on trial Engineering firm Balfour Beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the Hatfield rail crash in 2000.
2	Four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed.
2	Balfour Beattys railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at Hatfield, Hertfordshire.
2	Balfour Beatty managers Anthony Walker and Nicholas Jeffries, and Railtrack managers Alistair Cook, Sean Fugill and Keith Lea all face individual charges.
2	All five men, along with four others, are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws.
2	Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge.
2	It is expected the trial could last as long as a year.
2	The accident, on 17 October 2000, happened when the London to Leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph, when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail.
2	The accident on the East Coast Main Line sparked major disruption.
2	The overall responsibility for the line was Railtracks - the company that has now become Network Rail.
2	Those who died in the accident were Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex; Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds; Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford, Nottingham; and Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand.
2	Final hunts held as ban looms Hunts in England and Wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal, with more due out later.
2	Thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets, many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a Thursday.
2	The ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 GMT on Friday.
2	The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.
2	But the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits.
2	Others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.
2	Anti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law.
2	Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, told BBC News: Weve long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do.
2	But if they continue to chase foxes, to chase wild mammals around the countryside, thats against the law and were confident theyll be brought to justice. At the headquarters of Quorn hunt in Leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt.
2	BBC correspondent Sarah Mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.
2	She said many people did not share the Countryside Alliances optimism that hunting would be able to continue.
2	Farmer Geoff Brooks, a senior member of the Quorn hunt, told BBC News peoples lives revolved around hunting.
2	He described the ban as ridiculous and badly thought out but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.
2	At the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, the Countryside Alliance failed in its attempt to have the Hunting Act ruled invalid.
2	But it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.
2	The alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on Saturday.
2	The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions.
2	The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules.
2	A spokesman said: Basically, its not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well. The decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected.
2	He said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.
2	Falconer rebuts charade claims Concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy, the lord chancellor has said.
2	Ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill amid chaotic scenes in the Commons on Tuesday.
2	Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer.
2	He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear.
2	The bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves.
2	Ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards.
2	Critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment, including food and fluids.
2	Tony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill.
2	But changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from Hillsborough coma victim Tony Bland.
2	It is important we dont end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen, he said.
2	On Tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs.
2	The revolt was also reduced by news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill.
2	But that only came after MPs bombarded Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark.
2	Eventually, he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes, prompting claims of a shambles.
2	The deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.
2	Lord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords.
2	He told BBC News: We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.
2	The motive has got to be to end suffering. He denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion.
2	It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a sensible solution, he said.
2	I dont think it is something to be embarrassed about.
2	These issues are not easy to deal with, he went on.
2	BBC political editor Andrew Marr said Mr Lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance.
2	But Lord Falconer praised his minister for an excellent job.
2	Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, one of the chief critics of the plans, condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.
2	School sport is back, says PM Tony Blair has promised that sport is back as a priority for schools.
2	The prime minister launched a £500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010.
2	Its an important part of education and its an important part of health, Mr Blair said.
2	But the Conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours PE within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.
2	The latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and Tai Chi being options.
2	Launching the initiative, Mr Blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London.
2	He said: Youve got to bring back school sport.
2	Its got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago.
2	Its still very, very important. Earlier, Education Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC News there were at least three areas which needed a coherent framework and dedicated funding.
2	These were training for PE teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions.
2	He added the government had originally pledged for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education a week.
2	The proportion was currently at 62%, and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010.
2	The money for the initiative will come from a new £500m fund.
2	The £500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400.
2	But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee.
2	Shadow spokesman for sport Hugh Robertson said: I suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer. He said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an anti-competitive sport agenda had been pursued in recent years.
2	Martin Ward, of the Secondary Heads Association, said members did not like ring-fenced funds and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.
2	Anti-terror plan faces first test Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament.
2	Tories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are poised to vote against the plans.
2	Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats.
2	Opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of UK citizens.
2	The government is expected to win Wednesdays vote in the Commons, but faces a battle in the House of Lords.
2	The Prevention of Terrorism Bill was published on Tuesday.
2	It proposes control orders, which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.
2	The two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge.
2	Tory shadow home secretary David Davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the Guildford Four - for which Tony Blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects.
2	Those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and thats why we have serious concerns abut that approach, he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme.
2	Mr Clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees.
2	He also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days.
2	The foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at Londons Belmarsh prison.
2	They are held under laws which the Law Lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 March.
2	The new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects.
2	Critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive UK citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years.
2	Opposition MPs are also angry they will have only two days - Wednesday and next Monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the House of Lords.
2	But the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.
2	In a rare move, the Tories and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are excessive.
2	It argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence.
2	Mr Davis told Today: It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned. He questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away.
2	Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: We believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians. Mr Clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be rash and negligent to ignore their advice.
2	Nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the UK and its interests, he argued.
2	Former NI minister Scott dies Former Northern Ireland minister Sir Nicholas Scott has died at a London hospice, his family has announced.
2	The former Conservative MP for Kensington and Chelsea, died after a long illness diagnosed as Alzheimers.
2	The 71-year-old served in Northern Ireland from 1981 to 1987 during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher.
2	As a Northern Ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he rode out the mass IRA escape from the Maze in 1983.
2	In education, he encountered criticism over school closures and the future of the Catholic training colleges.
2	He also merged the New University of Ulster and the Ulster Polytechnic to create the University of Ulster.
2	Sir Nicholas was a strong defender of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was held in esteem in Dublin government and SDLP circles.
2	But he experienced hostility from unionists some of whom dubbed him Minister of Discord.
2	After leaving Northern Ireland in a reshuffle, he became a UK disability minister.
2	Sir Nicholas was replaced as the member for Kensington and Chelsea by the flamboyant Alan Clark, after being deselected by his constituency in December 1996.
2	His deselection followed a series of scandals including being found slumped in the street by police during the Tory Party conference in Bournemouth and taken back to his hotel.
2	Sir Nicholas claimed strong painkillers he was taking for a back problem had reacted badly with a small amount of alcohol.
2	After his sacking, he bitterly said that despite the support of Cabinet ministers and Tory backbenchers, the Eurosceptics in his constituency were absolutely determined to get rid of me.
2	His colourful career also included a very public disagreement with daughter Victoria over civil rights for the disabled.
2	Sir Nicholas admitted he misled MPs when he denied his department had been involved in wrecking tactics designed to kill the Disability Bill in 1994.
2	Victoria, a lobbyist for disabled rights, denounced her fathers actions and heaped insult on injury when she joined the calls for him to resign.
2	He joined the backbenches two months later.
2	Blair rejects Iraq advice calls Tony Blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the Iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.
2	The prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the Attorney General.
2	Earlier, Conservative MP Michael Mates joined calls for a probe into claims Lord Goldsmiths statement to Parliament was drawn up at Number 10.
2	Mr Blair said the statement was a fair summary of Lord Goldsmiths opinion.
2	Thats what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and thats what I say.
2	He has dealt with this time and time and time again, Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street.
2	He refused to answer further questions on the issue, saying it had been dealt with literally scores of times and the position has not changed.
2	Lord Goldsmith has denied being leaned on and says the words written were his.
2	The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.
2	Mr Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence, told the BBC on Friday: That, as a general rule, is right, but its not an absolute rule. He said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding Prince Charless marriage plans.
2	The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said.
2	Mr Mates added: We discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers advice to the government has been published.
2	And this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister. This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: Firstly, we havent broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it. In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blairs Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.
2	But a short statement about Lord Goldsmiths position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action.
2	Mr Sands book suggests it was actually written by Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan.
2	Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.
2	She told the BBC the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code.
2	My view is we need the House of Lords to set up a special committee, summon the attorney, get all the papers out, look at exactly what happened, she said.
2	The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.
2	On Thursday, Lord Goldsmith said his statement had not been written by or at Number 10.
2	In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions, he said.
2	Police probe BNP mosque leaflet Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.
2	Anti-racism campaigners in Swansea have handed copies to South Wales Police.
2	Swanseas Muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former St Andrews United Reform Church.
2	The building on George Street has been derelict since the 1980s.
2	Taha Idris, director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council, said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public.
2	Im quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the BNP in Swansea, he said.
2	The BNP has tried in the past to get into Swansea and this is another example of them trying again.
2	I am in no doubt that the BNP are not needed and not wanted here. A South Wales Police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet.
2	According to the BNPs website, they have been posted to homes in the Castle ward.
2	The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin - who lives near Welshpool, mid Wales - delivering the leaflet.
2	The BNP has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion, but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest.
2	Swansea Unite Against Fascism (UAF) is meeting this week to plan a campaign.
2	Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim, an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea, it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1,000 people.
2	It is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.
2	Andy Richards, of Swansea UAF, said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the BNP.
2	The people of Swansea will not put up with this. Swanseas Muslim community bought the former church, just across the road from the existing mosque on St Helens Road, in the late 1990s.
2	Mr Idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building.
2	It is a landmark building in Swansea and would otherwise just crumble, he said.
2	It is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner.
2	It will be a Muslim community centre.
2	Its a holistic place used for education, weddings, deaths and births. He said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions Muslims had to travel to Llanelli for cultural events.
2	Blair says mayor should apologise Tony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his Nazi comment to a Jewish reporter.
2	Labours Mr Livingstone, who says he is standing by his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a concentration camp guard.
2	Mr Blair told Fives Wright Stuff show: Lets just apologise and move on. Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.
2	Mr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.
2	A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise, he said.
2	Lets just apologise and move on - thats the sensible thing. Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstones remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use.
2	Its particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face, he said.
2	I think its a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party.
2	We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said.
2	I think thats a matter of great regret. The row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britains first gay MP.
2	On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a German war criminal.
2	Mr Finegold replies: No, Im Jewish, I wasnt a German war criminal.
2	Im quite offended by that. The mayor then says: Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, arent you? At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise.
2	If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong, he told reporters.
2	The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess Londons bid for the 2012 Games.
2	An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England.
2	It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.
2	Jowell confirms casino climbdown Tessa Jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the UK to 24, in a move branded a humiliating retreat by the Tories.
2	It puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos, originally outlined in the governments Gambling Bill.
2	Instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small, medium and large.
2	The Culture Secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.
2	But Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a shambles.
2	This announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government.
2	Instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill, to liberalise the rules governing gambling, the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present. Shares in British casino operators London Clubs International, Rank Group and Stanley Leisure, who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos, fell by between 10 and 25% following the announcement.
2	Ms Jowells deputy, Richard Caborn, said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue, and responded to the concerns raised.
2	Limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling, he said.
2	We also believe its right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos. He added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas.
2	Church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos.
2	Salvation Army spokesman Jonathan Lomax said: The proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the [three year] trial period, which we think should last at least five years, will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling. But British British Casino Association Chairman Penny Cobham said her members were outraged by the decision, which followed a campaign in the Daily Mail newspaper.
2	There was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos.
2	Talk of a casino on every High Street was just a scaring tactic. Security papers found in street An inquiry is under way after files containing security details about the Pakistani presidents visit to London were found by a member of the public.
2	The files are believed to contain detailed security arrangements for Gen Pervez Musharrafs visit this week, including police codes.
2	Scotland Yard said the policing operation had been reviewed.
2	A spokesman said President Musharrafs safety had not been compromised, as the papers had been handed in promptly.
2	We cannot discuss who was responsible for the documents, only that they contained the policing arrangements for the official visit, said the spokesman.
2	The papers are believed to have been found by a member of the public in a street in Mayfair and given to the Mirror newspaper.
2	The police spokesman said the newspaper handed the report over on Monday.
2	The forces Directorate of Professional Standards is investigating the circumstances surrounding the loss of the documents, he said.
2	Gen Musharraf held talks with Tony Blair on Monday.
2	He arrived in Britain on Sunday night after flying from the United States, where he met President George W Bush.
2	He is due to visit the Pakistani community in Manchester on Tuesday afternoon.
2	Blair congratulates Bush on win Tony Blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term as president.
2	Mr Bushs re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was fractured, divided and uncertain, Mr Blair said.
2	It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey.
2	Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.
2	But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values he added.
2	Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the worlds single most pressing political challenge of the present day, Mr Blair warned.
2	The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to build anew their alliance.
2	All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge.
2	It is urgent that we do so. Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerrys campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election a true celebration of American democracy.
2	The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added.
2	Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his warmest congratulations, saying: We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.
2	Mr Bushs first task was to rebuild a sense of domestic purpose within the US, he said.
2	Mr Kennedy said: Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism. Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an umbilical cord between Mr Bush and the UK premier.
2	Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security.
2	Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come. Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.
2	Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday.
2	Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bushs refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions.
2	Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news.
2	But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change.
2	He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.
2	Howard truanted to play snooker Conservative leader Michael Howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.
2	Mr Howard said his time at Jacks Snooker Hall in Llanelli in the 1950s had not done him any lasting damage.
2	But he told the Times Educational Supplement that truancy was very bad and said firm action was needed.
2	Mr Howard also called for a return to O-levels and more classroom discipline.
2	Mr Howard eventually left Llanelli Grammar School - and the snooker hall - to go to Cambridge University.
2	He said: I dont think its done me any lasting damage.
2	Nor has it made me a snooker world champion.
2	There might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.
2	Im just being honest.
2	I think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it. Another player who has failed to win snookers world championship - Jimmy the Whirlwind  White - has previously admitted missing lessons, instead spending his days in smoky halls.
2	Tony Meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there, Mr White said, We loved the game and the atmosphere.
2	School went out of the window.
2	I went for a while and then started taking time off. Mr Howards fellow Welshman Ray Reardon - known by his fellow professionals as Dracula - won the snooker world championship six times, having left school at 14 to work as a miner.
2	And Terry Griffiths, like Mr Howard from Llanelli, won the tournament in 1979.
2	It is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at Jacks.
2	Short attacks US over tsunami aid Former Cabinet minister Clare Short has criticised the US-led tsunami aid coalition, saying the UN should be leading efforts.
2	President Bush has announced that an alliance of the US, India, Australia and Japan will co-ordinate a humanitarian drive.
2	But Ms Short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the UN.
2	She said only the UN had the moral authority to lead the relief work.
2	Ms Short resigned as international development secretary over the Iraq war.
2	I think this initiative from America to set up four countries claiming to co-ordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the UN when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up, she said.
2	Only really the UN can do that job, she told BBC Radio Fours PM programme.
2	It is the only body that has the moral authority.
2	But it can only do it well if it is backed up by the authority of the great powers. Ms Short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters.
2	The US was very bad at coordinating with anyone and India had its own problems, Ms Short said.
2	I dont know what that is about but it sounds very much, I am afraid, like the US trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the UN system, she added.
2	Guantanamo four free in weeks All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.
2	Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years.
2	They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led war on terror.
2	Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after intensive and complex discussions over security.
2	He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003.
2	All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.
2	But he added: Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity. The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees.
2	But he said there were still serious questions both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained.
2	Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a legal no-mans land.
2	Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process. Azmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his sons release.
2	He added: If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they havent, they shouldnt have been there. Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner.
2	She said: They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down.
2	They didnt do that.
2	They colluded with it. Moazzam Beggs Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges.
2	Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: People get released from prison when its found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money.
2	I dont see any difference in this case. Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba.
2	Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a major human-rights scandal and an icon of lawlessness.
2	Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as long overdue.
2	Civil rights group Liberty said it was delighted but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.
2	Director Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to practise what it preaches and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons.
2	Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars.
2	The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta.
2	Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.
2	Tories attack EU asylum moves David Blunkett has been accused of using the politics of confusion to disguise new EU immigration measures.
2	Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain.
2	The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states.
2	Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.
2	He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK.
2	If we dont like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people, he said.
2	The home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his Tory opposite number Mr Davis.
2	The government is employing the politics of confusion - I think, deliberately, argued Mr Davis.
2	By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto. On Monday Tony Blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of British borders.
2	He said an enlarged 25-member EU needs a streamlined decision making process.
2	Mr Davis said once Britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the UK open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant.
2	He accused the government of being pathetic when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of surrendering on the issue.
2	And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over.
2	Mr Blair told his monthly news conference Britain had the best of both worlds and would keep the veto.
2	There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls, he said.
2	With the Treaty of Amsterdam seven years ago, we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe. Mr Blunkett met his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.
2	The 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy, in favour of the qualified majority voting (QMV) system.
2	Under this scheme larger states such as Britain are expected to have more power than the smaller EU states.
2	Britain is expected to retain an opt-in right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with.
2	Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a European asylum solution.
2	If we dont work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours, said Mr Oaten.
2	The Liberal Democrats have long argued that Britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but its right that we dont do this in isolation. Cherie accused of attacking Bush Cherie Blair has been accused of criticising George W Bushs policies in a private address she gave during a United States lecture tour.
2	The prime ministers wife is said to have praised the Supreme Court for overruling the White House on the legal rights of Guantanamo Bay detainees.
2	The Tories said she broke a convention that British political figures do not act in a partisan way when abroad.
2	But Downing Street said she was speaking in her capacity as a lawyer.
2	It said she was not expressing political opinions.
2	Mrs Blairs remarks are said to have been made in a speech to law students in Massachusetts.
2	She said the decision by the US Supreme Court to give legal protection to two Britons held at Guantanamo Bay was a significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law.
2	She also described the US legal code as an outdated grandfather clock and welcomed a decision to throw out a law backed by Mr Bush relating to sodomy in Texas.
2	BBC news correspondent Gary ODonoghue said Mrs Blair was likely to face further calls for restraint, since the US election is imminent.
2	There have been some objections from people reasonably close to the Bush administration about her making these comments in their backyard just two days before a presidential election, he said.
2	Conservatives here too have made their feelings clear.
2	Cherie Booth has always regarded herself as having an independent career.
2	She has continued to practise as a major human rights lawyer in the courts.
2	Its not unusual for her to make these sorts of criticisms clear but it can be embarrassing. Tsunami wont divert Africa aid UK aid to help the victims of the Asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from Africa, Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised.
2	Mr Blair told the BBCs Breakfast with Frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not invade the money Britain wanted to spend on Africa.
2	Questioned about the disaster, he said his faith in God had not been shaken.
2	He added he would give new figures on the number of tsunami-related British deaths to the Commons on Monday.
2	Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Friday that about 440 Britons were either dead or missing in the disaster.
2	Mr Blair told Sundays programme: Since Jack Straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they havent moved a great deal, which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers.
2	But we just cant be sure.
2	It is just an immensely difficult job to get absolutely accurate figures, all countries are struggling with this. He said the £50 million originally allocated from the Department for International Development was now well on the way to being spent.
2	But the exact allocation could not be clarified until the World Bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected.
2	Within the next few weeks a clearer picture would emerge of the long-term costs of reconstruction, he added.
2	But he pledged that Africa - which sees a preventable tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict, disease and poverty - would not be neglected.
2	As Britain takes up its presidency of the G8 group of leading nations, Mr Blair said ministers had a big agenda for Africa.
2	For the first time we have a plan that wont just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within African countries and conflict resolution, he said.
2	A lot of the problems in Africa come from conflict, that again are preventable, but only with the right systems in place. Mandelson warning to BBC The BBC should steer away from demonising ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson has said.
2	The European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour dirty tricks campaign.
2	That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbells campaigning skills.
2	He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before.
2	That was a reference to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street sexed up Iraqs weapons of mass destruction dossier.
2	The affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan.
2	Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howards past.
2	Mr Mandelson, a former Labour communications director, told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills.
2	What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda.
2	In my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy.
2	I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign.
2	I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before. Mr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning.
2	Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said Mr Campbells return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard - recently withdrawn from the partys website - were a sign of abusive politics.
2	The government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future, he said on Sunday.
2	Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks.
2	This feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might, she said.
2	Blair pressing US on climate Tony Blair is pressing the US to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Downing Street has indicated.
2	Officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator John McCain recently visited Mr Blair.
2	Climate change was an issue the prime minister wanted to progress during the UKs presidency of the G8 and EU in 2005, said a spokesman.
2	But he played down reports Mr Blair was considering a new US-friendly treaty.
2	According to the Times, the UK leader wants to end US isolation with a Kyoto-lite agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change.
2	He is said to have discussed the idea with Mr McCain during his time at Number 10.
2	The prime minister is said to believe the United States refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol on emissions is undermining other countries resolve to cut carbon dioxide production.
2	So far the US has refused to sign up to the Kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science.
2	President Bushs advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.
2	Europe, which disputes the claim, has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the United States and developing countries.
2	Mr Blairs reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions, says the Times.
2	But there is still apparently little prospect of America agreeing to cut emissions, which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress.
2	Mr Blair was left blushing on Wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.
2	Police chief backs drinking move A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.
2	However, Norfolk police chief Andy Hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed.
2	I dont subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it, he said.
2	His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the governments plans be put on hold.
2	Andy Hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 February.
2	I feel that is a premature position to be taking, he said.
2	Among those who have criticised the plans are the UKs top policeman Sir John Stevens.
2	The Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking epidemic.
2	However, Mr Hayman said: It would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, Im very sorry.
2	He said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation.
2	My view is that I have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen,  he said.
2	However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking.
2	But he is confident problems in the early days can be ironed out.
2	He believed the majority of people favoured this law change and we have to accept that lifestyles are changing.
2	But aspects such as transport, and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account.
2	Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended the Licensing Act, saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in Europe because of a tiny minority of violent binge drinkers.
2	A six-month transitional period starts on 7 February during which time venues can apply for extended licences.
2	The Conservatives have called for 24-hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved.
2	On Monday, the Lib Dems also called for a delay.
3	Honour for UK games maker Leading British computer games maker Peter Molyneux has been made an OBE in the New Year Honours list.
3	The head of Surreys Lionhead Studios was granted the honour for services to the computer games industry.
3	Mr Molyneux has been behind many of the ground-breaking games of the last 15 years such as Populous, Theme Park, Dungeon Keeper and Black and White.
3	He is widely credited with helping to create and popularise the so-called god-game genre.
3	Speaking to the BBC News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise.
3	Its come completely out of the blue, he said, I never would have guessed that Id have that kind of honour. He said he was surprised as much because, not too long ago, many people thought computer gaming was a fad.
3	It was thought to be like skateboarding, he said, a craze that everyone thought would go away. Now, he said, the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence.
3	Britain plays a big part in it, he said.
3	Its one of the founding nations that made the industry what it is. Mr Molyneux has been a pivotal figure in the computer games industry for almost 20 years.
3	His career started at Bullfrog Studios which in 1987 produced Populous one of the first God-games.
3	The title gave players control over the lives a small population of computerised people.
3	Mr Molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career.
3	I thought everyone would treat Populous as weird, he said, but it became a huge international success. He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black & White.
3	One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film.
3	The veteran game maker says he has one problem still to solve.
3	Being an absolute geek Ive got no idea what Im going to wear when I go and pick it up, he said.
3	Bush website blocked outside US Surfers outside the US have been unable to visit the official re-election site of President George W Bush.
3	The blocking of browsers sited outside the US began in the early hours of Monday morning.
3	Since then people outside the US trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it.
3	The blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers, but as a result of a policy decision by the Bush camp.
3	The international exclusion zone around georgewbush.
3	com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites.
3	Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney failed.
3	By contrast Netcrafts four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems.
3	The site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US.
3	Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site.
3	The pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers.
3	Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis.
3	On 21 October, the George W Bush website began using the services of a company called Akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors.
3	Mike Prettejohn, president of Netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November.
3	He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week.
3	Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign.
3	However, simply blocking non-US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too.
3	Akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites.
3	Blogger grounded by her airline A US airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog, or online diary.
3	Queen of the Sky, otherwise known as Ellen Simonetti, evolved into an anonymous semi-fictional account of life in the sky.
3	But after she posted pictures of herself in uniform, Delta Airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay.
3	Ms Simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images.
3	Delta Airlines declined to comment.
3	I was really shocked, I had no warning, Ms Simonetti told BBC News Online.
3	I never thought I would get in trouble because of the blog.
3	I thought if they had a problem, someone would have said something before taking action. The issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites.
3	Ms Simonetti was suspended on 25 September pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
3	A spokesperson for Delta Airlines told BBC News Online: All I can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media. She added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past.
3	Ms Simonetti started her personal blog in January to help her get over her mothers death.
3	She had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for, and created fictional names for cities and companies.
3	The airlines name was changed to Anonymous Airline and the city in which she was based was called Quirksville.
3	A large part of the blog contained fictional stories because Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti.
3	The images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother.
3	We often take pictures on flight or on layovers.
3	I just though why not include them on my blog for fun.
3	I never meant it as something to harm my company and dont understand how they think it did harm them, Ms Simonetti said.
3	She has also claimed that pictures of male Delta Airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web.
3	Of the 10 or so images on the site, only one showed Ms Simonettis flight wings.
3	They did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with.
3	I am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up, she said.
3	The images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended.
3	As far as Ms Simonetti knows, there is no company anti-blogging policy.
3	There is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management, but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear.
3	Jeffrey Matsuura, director of the law and technology programme at the University of Dayton, said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees.
3	There are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers, he said.
3	It was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly, was reasonable, and enforced fairly in company policy.
3	You have to remember that as an employee, you dont have total free speech anymore, he said.
3	Mr Matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog.
3	One of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them, but they may not be particularly clear when they [employees] do cross the line. He speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of Ms Simonetti in uniform were posted.
3	Whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited, and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line, he said.
3	Ms Simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs.
3	One of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken.
3	If they had asked me just take down the blog, I would have done it, but that was not been given to me as an option, she said.
3	This blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it.
3	If I had known it would cost me my job, I would not have done that. Camera phones are must-haves Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.
3	Globally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%.
3	The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008.
3	Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly must-have buy.
3	In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images.
3	But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images.
3	Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge.
3	By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.
3	Camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services).
3	This has changed in the last 18 months.
3	Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use.
3	Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.
3	Mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people.
3	These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs.
3	But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks.
3	Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving.
3	The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels.
3	Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera.
3	But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras.
3	Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs.
3	Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.
3	Images from camera phones have even made it into the art world.
3	An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.
3	The exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano.
3	But some uses for them have worried many organisations.
3	Intel, Samsung, the UKs Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked.
3	Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse.
3	Italys information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used.
3	But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers profits.
3	According to recent figures, Sony Ericssons profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones.
3	Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.
3	Games deserve a place in class Computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers.
3	Academics from the Institute of Education at London University found that games literacy was a key skill for youngsters.
3	As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say.
3	Pupils should also be able to create their own games, they say.
3	Like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young peoples lives, said project manager Caroline Pelletier.
3	Games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing, she said.
3	The researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning.
3	Researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing.
3	Without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be, they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity, said research fellow Diane Carr.
3	The second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them.
3	Sixth-form teacher Barney Oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film, TV and popular music at the A-level course he runs at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge.
3	For parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy.
3	Dr Andrew Burn, associate director of the Institute of Educations Centre for the Study of Children, Youth and Media moved to reassure anxious parents.
3	Games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film, television and literature do, he said.
3	But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games. The games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children.
3	At a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural, social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently, said Roger Bennett, director general of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association.
3	This report is further evidence, if it were needed, about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming.
3	They have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career. The three-year research project, which is being presented at a seminar on Tuesday in London, was partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry.
3	Nuclear body seeks new tech The computer systems used to monitor the worlds nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors.
3	A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old.
3	Such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide.
3	The agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software.
3	A major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate, secure online access to information, said project manager Livio Costantini.
3	IAEA inspectors make around 3,000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide.
3	They are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants, to carry out environmental checks, and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility.
3	The computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits, for instance, was built in the 1970s and largely paper based.
3	An IAEA spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack.
3	The organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in November, aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data, design blueprints of nuclear facilities, even satellite images of the plant.
3	Where possible, it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials.
3	Further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries, according to a spokesman.
3	Computer specialist at the IAEA, Peter Smith, would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques, more familiar to video games players, into the inspectors toolkit.
3	The commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world, he said.
3	If we could have that on our laptops, we could be walking through the plant seeing, on the laptop, how the plant should look.
3	And if theres a door in the wall that is not on our laptop, then we have a problem. The IAEA estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m.
3	So far it has only received $11m from the US and the UK.
3	Failure to replace the hardware and software, and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks, said an agency statement.
3	Web logs aid disaster recovery Some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern Asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs.
3	Bloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help.
3	Indian writer Rohit Gupta edits a group blog called Dogs without Borders.
3	When he created it, the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between India and Pakistan.
3	But in the wake of Sundays tsunami, Mr Gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears.
3	They wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath.
3	One Sri Lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name Morquendi.
3	With internet service disrupted by the tsunami, Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka.
3	We started publishing these SMSes, says Mr Gupta.
3	Morquendi was describing scenes like 1,600 bodies washed up on a shore, and people burying, and burying and burying them.
3	People digging holes with their hands.
3	And this was coming through an SMS message.
3	We didnt have visual accounts on radio or on TV, or in the print media. Soon, thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read Morquendis first hand accounts.
3	In one message, Morquendi wrote about a Sri Lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit.
3	She was being swept away, Morquendis message read.
3	She grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other.
3	She says she watched the water pull her friend away. Mr Gupta says the power of Morquendis text message blogs was palpable.
3	He was running around, looking for friends, burying bodies, carrying bodies, Mr Gupta says of Morquendi.
3	I cant even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports, and doing the relief work at the same time.
3	He was caught between being a journalist and being a human being. Others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts.
3	Dina Mehta is an Indian blogger whos helping with the newly created South East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog.
3	She says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts.
3	What were doing is were building a resource, she says.
3	Anyone who says, OK, I want to come and do some work in India, volunteer in India, or in Sri Lanka or Malaysia, this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines, relief agencies, aid agencies, contacts for them etc. Ms Mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs.
3	Imagine if they had this resource available to them, if there was a disaster, how quickly you could funnel aid in, and get people to help, she says.
3	Bloggers in the United States are also getting involved.
3	Ramdhan Yadav Kotamaraja is originally from India, but now lives in Dallas.
3	Mr Kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends.
3	So, he set up an online payment system on his website.
3	Then, says Mr Kotamaraja, the blogging world found out.
3	All my blogger friends started linking up my site, and I saw a lot of people other than my friends.
3	Id say 70% of the donations came from people I dont know.
3	Its simply unbelievable to me, that people that I dont know will come and start donating. News spreads quickly on weblogs, a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope.
3	In Sri Lanka, blogger Morquendi is recruiting others to help.
3	One recruit calls himself Heretic.
3	In one of his latest posts, Heretic asks: Have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road? Ever seen a bus inside a house? Well, Heretic writes, that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you? He concludes: Keep it blogged.

3	Pandas benefit from wireless net The worlds dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.
3	The Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world.
3	A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas daily activities.
3	The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world.
3	The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.
3	Using the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs chances of survival.
3	Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world, said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve.
3	Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings. The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong.
3	It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.
3	Before the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve.
3	Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data.
3	To foster cultural links across the globe, a childrens learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children), an international non-profit organisation.
3	It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland, Oregon in the US.
3	Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world, said Globio founder Gerry Ellis.
3	Search wars hit desktop PCs Another front in the on-going battle between Microsoft and Google is about to be opened.
3	By the end of 2004 Microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a PC hard drive.
3	The move is in answer to Googles release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop PCs.
3	The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as Google, AOL, Yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files.
3	Microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results.
3	John Connors, Microsofts chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year.
3	Were going to have a heck of a great race in search between Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, he said.
3	Its going to be really fun to follow. Microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals, many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users.
3	The program could be based on the software Microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of Lookout Software in early October.
3	On 14 October Google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a PC and lets users use one tool to find e-mail messages, spreadsheets, text files and presentations.
3	The software will also find webpages and messages sent via AOL Instant Messenger.
3	Many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too.
3	Companies such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.
3	Apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the Tiger operating system.
3	Due to follow are net giants AOL and Yahoo.
3	The latter recently bought Stata Labs to get its hands on search software that people can use.
3	Microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of Windows (codenamed Longhorn).
3	However this is not likely to appear until 2006.
3	The recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword-based web search, said Kathy Rittweger, co-founder of Blinkx.
3	Finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist. Desktop search has become important for several reasons.
3	According to research by message analysts the Radicati Group up to 45% of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in e-mail messages and attachments.
3	JF Sullivan, spokesman for e-mail software firm Sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work.
3	The key thing is being able to manage all this information, he said.
3	Also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet.
3	Many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net.
3	Many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using.
3	Having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online.
3	For companies such as Google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money.
3	But this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools.
3	Home phones face unclear future The fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species.
3	Research by handset maker Nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take.
3	According to the study, more than 45 million people in the UK, Germany, US and South Korea now only use a mobile.
3	It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile.
3	The Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes.
3	Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends.
3	In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile.
3	However, when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared.
3	In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds.
3	In all the countries where interviews were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile.
3	Women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone, the research found.
3	The move to mobile was most pronounced in South Korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile.
3	18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house.
3	Many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the cosiness of making a call there.
3	Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap, reliable and providing good call quality.
3	The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless.
3	Some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years.
3	Polling firm Mori interviewed more than 6,000 people in the UK, US, Germany and South Korea for the survey.
3	Podcasts mark rise of DIY radio An Apple iPod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill.
3	But more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers.
3	It is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry.
3	Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod, although you do not need an iPod to create one or to listen to a podcast.
3	A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home.
3	They need only a microphone, a PC, and some editing software.
3	They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free.
3	Using technology based on XML computer code and RSS - Really Simple Syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software, which Mr Curry has pioneered.
3	The latest MP3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically.
3	Mr Curry records, hosts, edits and produce a daily, 40 minute podcast called The Daily Source Code.
3	He wants to make podcasting the Next Big Thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry.
3	I was always into technologies and wires, he explains.
3	My parents gave me the Radio Shack 101 project kit, which allows you to build an AM transmitter and subsequently an FM transmitter.
3	I had my mom drive me around the block, see how far it would reach on the car radio. Mr Curry is American, but he grew up in the Netherlands where he hosted illegal, pirate radio shows in the Dutch capital.
3	He tried university in the US, and ended up back in Holland where he hosted a music video show.
3	He spent the next seven years in New York where he worked at MTV hosting the Top 20 Video Countdown, but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet.
3	At a certain point in 1995, I was driving in on a Friday afternoon, beautiful blue sky, one of those beautiful days thinking, this is so stupid.
3	You know, Im going do the Top 20 Countdown, take the cheque, go home, and sit on the internet until three in the morning.
3	So, after I finished the show, I quit.
3	I said, on air, its been great, Ive been here for seven years at that point, theres something on the internet, Ive got to go find it, and Ill see you later. But Mr Currys technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available.
3	The MP3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before.
3	Most importantly, Mr Curry says, people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing.
3	Listen to 99% of the radio that you hear today, its radio voices, and its fake, its just fake. He wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet.
3	He wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like, iPods.
3	Mr Curry is not a computer programmer, so he asked others to create one for him.
3	No one did, so he tried to write one himself.
3	He finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked. He put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it; the result is a work in progress called ipodder.
3	Doug Kaye, a California-based podcaster, praises the former MTV VJ for what he has done.
3	Adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem.
3	Ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the MP3 player, he explains.
3	People can wake up in the morning, pick up their iPods as they go to work or before they go exercise, and discover that theres all this new content automatically put onto their players. It is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in Australia, Finland, Brazil, even Malaysia.
3	One couple broadcasts theirs, The Dawn and Drew Show, from Wisconsin in the US, sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed.
3	Topics range from the comfort of their bed, to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners.
3	Already, websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.
3	Chris McIntyre runs Podcast Alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen.
3	If I were to tell my mom, or my mother-in-law to copy an XML or RSS file to their podcast aggregator, they would think I was speaking a foreign language, Mr McIntyre says.
3	Along with technical challenges, there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite, albeit copyrighted, music.
3	Some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the anti-radio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting.
3	Already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world.
3	Heineken is doing its own podcast now, and so is Playboy.
3	For his part, Adam Currys pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be.
3	He loves doing The Daily Source Code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences.
3	He has even been called the Ed Sullivan or Johnny Carson of podcasting which, he says, is a badge Ill wear with great honour.
3	To be the Johnny Carson, or Ed Sullivan of anything is wonderful.
3	And you know what? You dont need a hell of a lot of talent.
3	You just have to be nice, have your ears open, and let people shine.
3	And thats good for me. Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.
3	Sony wares win innovation award Sony has taken the prize for top innovator at the annual awards of PC Pro Magazine.
3	It won the award for taking risks with products and for its brave commitment to good design.
3	Conferring the award, PC Pros staff picked out Sonys PCG-X505/P Vaio laptop as a stunning piece of engineering.
3	The electronics giant beat off strong competition from Toshiba and chip makers AMD and Intel to take the gong.
3	Paul Trotter, news and features editor of PC Pro, said several Sony products helped it to take the innovation award.
3	He said Sonys Clie PEG UX50 media player with its swivel screen and qwerty keyboard broke the design rules yet again.
3	Other Sony products that helped included the Vaio W1 desktop computer and the RA-104 media server.
3	Mr Trotter said Sonys combining of computer, screen and keyboard in the W1 was likely to be widely copied in future home PCs.
3	The company has also become one of the first to use organic LEDs in its products.
3	While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats, said Mr Trotter.
3	Other awards decided by PC Pros staff and contributors included one for Canons EOS 300D digital camera in the Most Wanted Hardware category.
3	Microsofts Media Player 10 took the award for Most Wanted Software.
3	This year was the 10th anniversary of the PC Pro awards, which splits its prizes into two sections.
3	The first are chosen by the magazines writers and consultants, the second are voted for by readers.
3	Mr Trotter said more than 13,000 people voted for the Reliability and Service Awards, twice as many as in 2003.
3	Net-based memory and video card shop Crucial shared the award for Online Vendor of the year with Novatech.
3	Portable PlayStation ready to go Sonys PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.
3	The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves.
3	At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle.
3	Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.
3	Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4.
3	Konamis Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven.
3	Tony Hawks Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four.
3	There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Sharks Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.
3	Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version.
3	Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas.
3	The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan, it said.
3	Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.
3	Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone.
3	Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the games release.
3	Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States, said Xboxs Peter Moore.
3	Weve even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the Halo 2 flu on 9 November. Viewers to be able to shape TV Imagine editing Titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of Star Wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest.
3	Manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro (£5.1m) project funded by the European Union.
3	New Media for a New Millennium (NM2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre, which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes.
3	Viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots and even the sets and props of TV shows.
3	BT is one of 13 partners involved in the project.
3	It will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in CCTV pictures.
3	The software uses content recognition algorithms.
3	The three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs.
3	One of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the TV audience.
3	Participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact.
3	It is being developed in Finland and will be shown to Finnish TV audiences.
3	Another team will work on the BBCs big budget drama of Mervyn Peakes gothic fantasy Gormenghast.
3	It will be re-engineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions.
3	The BBC is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles, explained Dr Doug Williams of BT, who will be NM2s technical project manager.
3	The TV at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals.
3	This project is about teaching the machine to look at content like Lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense, he said.
3	At the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive TV which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows.
3	We are hoping to occupy the space in-between, he added.
3	NM2s co-ordinator Peter Stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience.
3	Viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes, he said.
3	Media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers. It will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said John Wyver, from TV producer Illuminations Television Limited, which is also involved in the project.
3	Its not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production, said Mr Wyver.
3	The tool has to know which bits fit together both visually, by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing, and in terms of the story. Only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing, he added.
3	Mr Wyver is planning a production entitled The Golden Age, about Renaissance art.
3	It will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry, music and architecture.
3	Other productions that the NM2 team will make range from news, documentaries to a romantic comedy drama.
3	Games maker fights for survival One of Britains largest independent game makers, Argonaut Games, has been put up for sale.
3	The London-based company behind the Harry Potter games has sacked about 100 employees due to a severe cash crisis.
3	The administrators told BBC News Online that selling Argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash.
3	Argonaut warned that it was low on cash 10 days ago when its shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange.
3	Argonaut has been making games for some 18 years and is one the largest independent games developers in the UK.
3	Along with its headquarters in north London, it operates studios in Cambridge and Sheffield.
3	Argonaut was behind the Harry Potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company.
3	But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers.
3	Signs that it was in trouble emerged in August, when it warned it was heading for losses of £6m in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games.
3	Those new deals were further delayed, leading Argonaut to warn in mid-October that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the London Stock Exchange.
3	As part of cost-cutting measures, some 100 employees were fired.
3	When the news about the £6m loss came out, we knew there were going to be redundancies, said Jason Parkinson, one of the game developers sacked by Argonaut.
3	A lot of people suspected that Argonaut had been in trouble for some time, he told BBC News Online.
3	Mr Parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save Argonaut from going under.
3	At the start of the year, the company employed 268 people.
3	After the latest round of cuts there are 80 staff at Argonaut headquarters in Edgware in north London, with 17 at its Morpheme offices in Kentish Town, London, and 22 at the Just Add Monsters base in Cambridge.
3	Argonaut called in administrators David Rubin & Partners on Friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse.
3	It spent the weekend going over the companys finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale.
3	The administrator told BBC News Online that the costs of restructuing would be too high, partly because of the overheads from the companys four premises across the UK.
3	It said it was hopeful that it could save some 110 jobs by selling the business, saying it had had expressions of interest from several quarters and were looking for a quick sale.
3	The administrator said it would ensure that staff made redundant would receive any wages, redundancy or holiday pay due to them, hopefully by Christmas.
3	Pompeii gets digital make-over The old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life.
3	A European Union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions.
3	It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii.
3	It could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism.
3	The technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.
3	The Lifeplus project is part of the EUs Information Society Technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage.
3	Engineers and researchers working in the Europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system.
3	It would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer.
3	The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitors viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements.
3	At Pompeii for example, the visitor would not just see the frescos, taverns and villas that have been excavated, but also people going about their daily life.
3	Augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as Troy and Lord of the Rings and in computer gaming.
3	This technology can now be used for much more than just computer games, said Professor Nadia Magnenat-Thalman of the Swiss research group MiraLab.
3	We are, for the first time, able to run this combination of software processes to create walking, talking people with believable clothing, skin and hair in real-time, she said.
3	Unlike virtual reality, which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer, the Lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views.
3	Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitors view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements.
3	The software capable of doing this has been developed by a UK company, 2d3.
3	Andrew Stoddart, chief scientist at 2d3, said that the EU project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life.
3	The popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer-generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life, he said.
3	Fast moving phone bugs appear Security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs.
3	The new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range.
3	The Cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the Symbian Series 60 phone operating system.
3	Despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of Cabir.
3	The original Cabir worm came to light in mid-June 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program.
3	A mistake in the way the original Cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.
3	However, the new Cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range Bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range.
3	Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres.
3	The risk of being infected by Cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it.
3	Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices.
3	Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone.
3	All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phones battery.
3	Anti-virus firm Sophos said the source code for Cabir had been posted on the net by a Brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created.
3	So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November.
3	Symbians Series 60 software is licenced by Nokia, LG Electronics, Lenovo, Panasonic, Samsung, Sendo and Siemens.
3	Joke e-mail virus tricks users A virus that disguises itself as a joke is spreading rapidly across the net.
3	Anti-virus firms are issuing high-level warnings about the new version of the Bagle e-mail program that seems to be catching a lot of people out.
3	The Windows virus grabs e-mail addresses from Microsoft Outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims.
3	When it infects a machine, the Bagle variant turns off security measures that usually protect PCs.
3	The new variant is called Bagle.
3	AT, Bagle.
3	BB and Bagle.
3	AU and the attachment bearing the virus code is labelled as either joke or price.
3	The body of the virus usually contains nothing but a smiley or emoticon.
3	The virus can strike computers running Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP.
3	Users will be infected if they open the attachment that travels with the e-mail.
3	As well as plundering Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses to send itself to, Bagle.
3	AT also tries to turn off the firewall and security centre services on Windows XP machines.
3	BBC News Online has received five warnings about the virus from security companies.
3	Finnish company F-Secure gave the virus its second highest threat level.
3	Weve had several reports all over the world, said Mikko Hypponen, director of anti-virus research for F-Secure.
3	Security firm Network Box said that it stopped more than 30,000 copies an hour of the virus as the outbreak reached a peak.
3	Black Spider said it had stopped more than 1 million copies of Bagle.
3	AT since the outbreak began at 0630 BST (0530 GMT).
3	Anti-virus firms urged users to be wary of unexpected e-mail messages bearing attachments and to update their software to ensure they are protected against the latest threats.
3	Progress on new internet domains By early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.
3	The .
3	post and .
3	travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the nets administrative body.
3	The names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann.
3	The other proposed names include a domain for pornography, Asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture.
3	The .
3	post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.
3	The .
3	travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online.
3	It is backed by a New York-based trade group called The Travel Partnership.
3	Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted.
3	Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service.
3	At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains.
3	One that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .
3	xxx domain for pornographic websites.
3	A similar proposal has been made many times in the past.
3	But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it.
3	In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success.
3	Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .
3	museum and .
3	aero.
3	Others such as .
3	info and .
3	biz were intended to be more generic.
3	In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations.
3	But domains that end in the .
3	com suffix are by far the most numerous.
3	Argonaut founder rebuilds empire Jez San, the man behind the Argonaut games group which went into administration a week ago, has bought back most of the company.
3	The veteran games developer has taken over the Cambridge-based Just Add Monsters studios and the London subsidiary Morpheme.
3	The Argonaut group went into administration due to a severe cash crisis, firing about half of its staff.
3	In August it had warned of annual losses of £6m for the year to 31 July.
3	Jez San is one of the key figures in the UKs games industry.
3	The developer, who received an OBE in 2002, was estimated to have been worth more than £200m at the peak of the dotcom boom.
3	He founded Argonaut in 1982 and has been behind titles such as 1993 Starfox game.
3	More recently it was behind the Harry Potter games for the PlayStation.
3	But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers.
3	In August it warned of annual losses of £6m, blaming delays in signing new contracts and tough conditions in the software industry.
3	The groups three subsidiaries were placed in administration a week ago, with Mr Sans resigning as the companys CEO and some 100 staff being fired.
3	After the latest round of cuts, there were 80 workers at Argonaut headquarters in Edgware in north London, with 17 at its Morpheme offices in Kentish Town, London, and 22 at the Just Add Monsters base in Cambridge.
3	Mr San has re-emerged, buying back Morpheme and Just Add Monsters.
3	We are pleased to announce the sale of these two businesses as going concerns, said David Rubin of administrators David Rubin & Partners.
3	This has saved over 40 jobs as well as the substantial employment claims that would have arisen had the sales not been achieved. Mr Rubin said the administrators were in talks over the sale of the Argonaut software division in Edgware and were hopeful of finding a buyer.
3	This is a very difficult time for all the employees there, but I salute their commitment to the business while we work towards a solution, he said.
3	Some former employees are angry at the way cash crisis was handled.
3	One told BBC News Online that the staff who had been fired had been financially ruined in the space of a day.
3	Dozens held over ID fraud site Twenty-eight people, including a Briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud.
3	Those arrested are accused of operating Shadowcrew.
3	com, which investigators claim was a global clearing house for criminals involved in credit card fraud.
3	A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed.
3	Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven nations.
3	The British teenager was arrested on Wednesday but details only emerged on Friday.
3	He has now been bailed to return to a Surrey police station in December.
3	All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole peoples identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies.
3	The authorities in the US, who have indicted 19 people in Newark, New Jersey, estimate the fraud caused losses of more than $4m.
3	Assistant US Attorney Scott Christie said several people had been arrested in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Poland and Sweden.
3	Mr Christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a Russian, Anatoly Tyukanov.
3	Investigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites - Shadowcrew, Carderplanet and Darkprofits.
3	The US Secret Service was first tipped off in July 2003.
3	An NHTCU spokeswoman said the American investigators went undercover on the Shadowcrew website and discovered some of the sites 4,000 members were using it for organised crime purposes.
3	She said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, drivers licences, passports and birth certificates.
3	The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said.
3	The Shadowcrew site, which has now been taken over by the US Secret Service, listed several discussion groups, in English and Russian, including one on hacking, spam and online anonymity tools.
3	The head of the NHTCU, Acting Detective Chief Superintendent, Mick Deats, said: This investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit.
3	We believe that the suspects have trafficked at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, leading to losses by financial institutions running into the millions. Chief Supt Deats went on to warn: The internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society; however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain.
3	Your identity is one of the most precious commodities.
3	Criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in e-commerce, will be targeted by law enforcement. Robots learn robotiquette rules Robots are learning lessons on robotiquette - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans.
3	By playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations.
3	The studys findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction.
3	The work is part of the European Cogniron robotics project, and was on show at Londons Science Museum.
3	We are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists, said Professor Kerstin Dautenhahn, project leader at Hertfordshire.
3	Our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans. The research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator.
3	Without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds, Professor Dautenhahn told BBC News Online.
3	And I want robots to treat humans as human beings, and not like other robots, she added.
3	In most situations, a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person, but also with groups of people.
3	To find out how they would react, the Hertfordshire Cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children.
3	Showing off its skills at the Science Museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye.
3	It even used speech to give instructions and play music.
3	However, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the robotiquette for human interaction.
3	If you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future, concluded Professor Dautenhahn.
3	It might take even longer because it is very, very hard to develop such a robot. You can hear more on this story on the BBC World Services Go Digital programme.
3	Concerns over Windows ATMs Cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses, a security firm has warned.
3	The warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the Windows operating system in machines.
3	Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system.
3	But banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small.
3	For many years the venerable IBM operating system, known as OS/2, has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world.
3	But IBM will end support for OS/2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives.
3	There are also other pressures making banks turn to Windows said Dominic Hirsch, managing director of financial analysis firm Retail Banking Research.
3	He said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new Europay, Mastercard and Visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data.
3	US laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways.
3	Todd Thiemann, spokesman for anti-virus firm Trend Micro, said the move to Windows in cash machines was not without risks.
3	Mr Thiemann said research by the TowerGroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were Windows based.
3	Already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.
3	In January 2003 the Slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
3	In August of the same year, cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the Welchia worm.
3	Incidents like this happen, said Mr Thiemann, because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers.
3	This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.
3	This could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system, he said.
3	Banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network, Mr Thiemann told BBC News Online.
3	But Mr Hirsch from Retail Banking Research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.
3	Currently, he said, a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all ATMs get swapped for a newer model every year.
3	Windows cash machines have been around for several years, he said.
3	Most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle. In theory there is a bigger threat with Windows than OS/2, he said, but I do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment. Its pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with ATMs, he said.
3	The many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously, he said.
3	Banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all, he added.
3	A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services (Apacs) which represents the UKs payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal.
3	Theres no concern that theres going to be any type of virus hitting the UK networks, he said.
3	Risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect UK cash machines together and the operators of the ATMs themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the US where viruses have struck.
3	Attack prompts Bush site block The official re-election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons.
3	The blocking began early on Monday so those outside the US and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it.
3	But keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective.
3	Many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses.
3	The policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.
3	com website.
3	Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign said: The measure was taken for security reasons. He declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy.
3	The barring of non-US visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place.
3	In early October a so-called denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs.
3	The attack made the site unusable for about five hours.
3	About the same time the web team of the Bush-Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic.
3	Akamai uses a web-based tool called EdgeScape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based.
3	Typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages, video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic.
3	Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis.
3	Readers of the Boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the George W Bush domain name.
3	Ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site.
3	There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site.
3	The site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US.
3	Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site.
3	The international exclusion zone around georgewbush.
3	com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites.
3	Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney have failed.
3	By contrast Netcrafts four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems.
3	Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack.
3	Mike Prettejohn, Netcraft president, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November.
3	He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week.
3	Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign.
3	However, simply blocking non-US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too.
3	Most American soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the US militarys own portion of the net.
3	Akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites.
3	Loyalty cards idea for TV addicts Viewers could soon be rewarded for watching TV as loyalty cards come to a screen near you.
3	Any household hooked up to Sky could soon be using smartcards in conjunction with their set-top boxes.
3	Broadcasters such as Sky and ITV could offer viewers loyalty points in return for watching a particular channel or programme.
3	Sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in January, marketing magazine New Media Age reported.
3	Sky set-top boxes have two slots.
3	One is for the viewers decryption card, while the other has been dormant until now.
3	Loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets, as High Street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards.
3	Now similar schemes look set to enter the highly competitive world of multi-channel TV.
3	Viewers who stay loyal to a particular TV channel could be rewarded by free TV content or freebies from retail partners.
3	Broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs.
3	Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card, said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher.
3	Viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks, with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market, said Mr Whalley.
3	Credit cards that have been chipped could be used in set-top boxes to pay for movies, gambling and gaming.
3	The idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities.
3	It will be down to the ingenuity of the content players, said Mr Whalley.
3	For the BBC, revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to Freeview set-top boxes, said Mr Whalley.
3	Currently most Freeview boxes do not have a slot which would allow viewers to use a smartcard.
3	Some 7.4 million households have Sky boxes and Sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010.
3	Loyalty cards could play a role in this, particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their Sky subscriptions, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.
3	The Force is strong in Battlefront The warm reception that has greeted Star Wars: Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay, but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient.
3	Geared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights, set in an array of locations all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies.
3	Previous Star Wars titles like the acclaimed Knights Of The Old Republic and Jedi Knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchises extensive universe, and their use of weird and wonderful new characters.
3	Battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves.
3	The sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for.
3	The mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective, and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join Darth Vader on the Dark Side, depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the players personal propensity for good or evil.
3	There is ample chance to be a Wookie, shoot Ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up Luke Skywalker.
3	In each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet.
3	It really is no more complicated than that.
3	Locations include the frozen wastes of Hoth, the ice planet from The Empire Strikes Back, complete with massive mechanical AT-ATs on the march.
3	There are also the dusty, sinister deserts of Tatooine and Geonosis, as well as the forest moon of Endor, where Return Of The Jedis much-maligned Ewoks lived.
3	The feel of those places is well and truly captured, with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic.
3	It is worth noting though that on the PlayStation 2, the games graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the Xbox version.
3	The pivotal element behind Battlefronts success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war.
3	The number of combatants, noise and abundance of laser fire see to that, and the sense of chaos really comes over.
3	Speaking of noise, Battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the Star Wars galaxys audio motifs.
3	The multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar, as are the stirring John Williams symphonies that never let up.
3	There is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section.
3	It has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars, it would not stand up for long.
3	The gameplay is reliable, bog-standard stuff, short on originality.
3	There are also odd annoyances, like the games insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action, an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear.
3	And some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be.
3	That said, it is still great fun to pilot a Scout Walker or Speeder Bike, however non user-friendly they prove.
3	Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game.
3	The above-average AI of the enemy sees to that, although given the frenetic environments they operate in, their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated.
3	Battlefronts novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast, leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game.
3	But for a while, it is an absolute blast, and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from George Lucas stable.
3	Ultimate game award for Doom 3 Sci-fi shooter Doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony, the Golden Joystick awards.
3	It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas.
3	The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August.
3	Other winners included Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which took the Most Wanted for Christmas prize.
3	Only released last week, it was closely followed by Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month.
3	But they missed out on the prize for the Most Wanted game of 2005, which went to the Nintendo title, The Legend of Zelda.
3	The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics.
3	It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter.
3	Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (£8.3m).
3	The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam.
3	The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004.
3	Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week.
3	It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time.
3	Electronic Arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from Nintendo which won in 2003.
3	The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines.
3	Games awards like this have grown in importance.
3	Over the last six years, the UK market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record £1,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts Screen Digest.
3	Gadget show heralds MP3 season Partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this Christmas.
3	With Apples iPod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough iPod minis to go round, predicts Oliver Irish, editor of gadget magazine Stuff.
3	The iPod mini is likely to be this years Tracey Island, said Mr Irish.
3	Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one.
3	For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend.
3	Star of the show will be Sonys Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations.
3	But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot.
3	He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan.
3	He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him, said Mr Irish.
3	Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface.
3	The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple.
3	Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish.
3	Demand is huge and Apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on iPod minis, said Mr Irish.
3	For those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented, the Gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with GPS and GPRS, that also doubles up as an MP3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must-have.
3	What is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them, said Mr Irish.
3	This Christmas, gadgets will not be an all-male preserve.
3	Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves, said Mr Irish.
3	Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks. Commodore finds new lease of life The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.
3	New owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers.
3	It also plans to develop a worldwide entertainment concept with the brand, although details are not yet known.
3	The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.
3	In the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.
3	The Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs.
3	It was followed a few years later by the Amiga.
3	The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day.
3	The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s.
3	Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers.
3	In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.
3	Tulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players.
3	It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games.
3	Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run.
3	The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.
3	Broadband in the UK growing fast High-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever.
3	BT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter.
3	The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million.
3	Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband.
3	Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe.
3	According to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people.
3	The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands.
3	The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name.
3	Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UKs most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.
3	Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds.
3	The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available.
3	This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas, said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell.
3	BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers.
3	This was a slight increase on the previous three months.
3	Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors.
3	Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customers home or office, is growing steadily.
3	Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services.
3	By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.
3	Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange.
3	There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.
3	Slim PlayStation triples sales Sony PlayStation 2s slimmer shape has proved popular with UK gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale.
3	Sales have tripled since launch, outstripping Microsofts Xbox, said market analysts Chart-Track.
3	The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
3	The title broke the UK sales record for video games in its first weekend of release.
3	Latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677,000 copies.
3	It is obviously very, very encouraging for Sony because Microsoft briefly outsold them last week, John Houlihan, editor of Computerandvideogames.
3	com told BBC News.
3	And with Halo 2 [for Xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and Xbox. Although Xbox sales over the last week also climbed, PS2 sales were more than double that.
3	The figures mean Sony is reaching the seven million barrier for UK sales of the console.
3	Edinburgh-based developer, Rockstar, which is behind the GTA titles, has seen San Andreas pull in an estimated £24m in gross revenues over the weekend.
3	In comparison, blockbuster films like Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban took £11.5m in its first three days at the UK box office.
3	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King took nearly £10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets.
3	Gangster-themed GTA San Andreas is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto Vice City which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever.
3	The Xbox game Halo 2, released on 11 November in the UK, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year.
3	The original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies.
3	Mr Houlihan added that Sony had done well with the PS2, but it definitely helped that the release of San Andreas coincided with the slimline PS2 hitting the shelves.
3	The run-up to Christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles.
3	Microsofts Xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales.
3	The sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since GTA San Andreas has an 18 certificate.
3	Sony and Microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005.
3	Both have hit crucial price points at around £100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales, said Mr Houlihan.
3	Seamen sail into biometric future The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.
3	As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ships crew is testing prototype versions of the worlds first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarers equivalent of a passport.
3	Along with the owners picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holders fingerprints.
3	The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers Identity Documents of June 2003.
3	Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards.
3	Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November.
3	Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.
3	Authenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards.
3	If youre issued a seafarers ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed, Authenti-corps CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBCs Go Digital programme.
3	She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention.
3	It aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea.
3	The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailors wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans.
3	By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world, said Ms Musselman.
3	It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers. US duo in first spam conviction A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers.
3	It is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors.
3	Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500.
3	They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses.
3	They will be formally sentenced next year.
3	A third defendant, Richard Rutkowski, was acquitted.
3	Prosecutors said Jaynes was a snake oil salesman in a new format, using the internet to peddle useless wares, news agency Associated Press reported.
3	A Fed-Ex refund processor was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home.
3	Another item on sale was an internet history eraser.
3	His sister helped him process credit card payments.
3	Jaynes amassed a fortune of $24m from his sales, prosecutors said.
3	Hes been successful ripping people off all these years, AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying.
3	Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said.
3	Prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for Jaynes, and a jail term for his sister.
3	But Jaynes lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term outrageous and said his client believed he was innocent.
3	He pointed out that all three of the accused lived in North Carolina and were unaware of the Virginia state law.
3	Spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60% of all e-mails sent.
3	US blogger fired by her airline A US airline attendant suspended over inappropriate images on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired.
3	Ellen Simonetti, known as Queen of the Sky, wrote an anonymous semi-fictional account of her life in the sky.
3	She was suspended by Delta in September.
3	In a statement, she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for wrongful termination.
3	A Delta spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that Ms Simonetti was no longer an employee.
3	Delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls internal employee matters.
3	A spokesperson reiterated this position on Wednesday, confirming only that Ms Simonetti was no longer with the company.
3	The spokesperson also confirmed that there were very clear rules attached to the unauthorised use of Delta branding, including uniforms.
3	Ms Simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 November.
3	She said in an official statement: As a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by Delta Airlines I am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the Federal Government EEOC [US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]. She added she had also hired a Texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages. Ms Simonetti told the BBC News website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 September.
3	Queen of the Sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the BBC News website and others.
3	Her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites.
3	The blog, which she started in January as a way of getting over her mothers death, contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts.
3	Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti.
3	In the postings, she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity.
3	But some postings contained images of herself in uniform.
3	Of the 10 or so images only one showed Ms Simonettis flight wings.
3	She removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension.
3	I never meant it as something to harm my company and dont understand how they think it did harm them, Ms Simonetti said.
3	A legal expert in the US speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted.
3	Delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition.
3	It has said it needs to cut between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs and reduce costs by $5bn (£2.7bn) a year.
3	Analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention.
3	Last week, it struck a $1bn cost-cutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy.
3	The deal would see pilots accept a 32% pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million Delta shares, unions said.
3	And on Monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007.
3	The airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from American Express.
3	Gates opens biggest gadget fair Bill Gates has opened the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, saying that gadgets are working together more to help people manage multimedia content around the home and on the move.
3	Mr Gates made no announcement about the next generation Xbox games console, which many gadget lovers had been hoping for.
3	About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and runs from 6 to 9 January.
3	The latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies will all be on show over the three days.
3	Mr Gates said that a lot of work had been done in the last year to sort out usability and compatibility issues between devices to make it easier to share content.
3	We predicted at the beginning of the decade that the digital approach would be taken for granted - but there was a lot of work to do.
3	What is fun is to come to the show and see what has been done.
3	It is going even faster than we expected and we are excited about it. He highlighted technology trends over the last year that had driven the need to make technology and transferring content across difference devices seamless.
3	Gaming is becoming more of a social thing and all of the social genres will use this rich communications.
3	And if we look at what has been going on with e-mail, instant messaging, blogging, entertainment - if we can make this seamless, we can create something quite phenomenal. Mr Gates said the PC, like Microsofts Media Centre, had a central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio, video and images but it would not be the only device.
3	It is the way all these devices work together which will make the difference, he said.
3	He also cited the success of the Microsoft Xbox video game Halo 2, released in November, which pushed Xbox console sales past PlayStation in the last two months of 2004 for the first time in 2004.
3	The game, which makes use of the Xbox Live online games service, has sold 6.23 million copies since its release.
3	People are online and playing together and that really points to the future, he said.
3	Several partnerships with device and hardware manufacturers were highlighted during Mr Gates speech, but there were few major groundbreaking new technology announcements.
3	Although most of these affected largely US consumers, the technologies highlighted the kind of trends to come.
3	These included what Mr Gates called an ecosystem of technologies, like SBCs IPTV, a high-definition TV and digital video recorder that worked via broadband to give high-quality and fast TV.
3	There were also other deals announced which meant that people could watch and control content over portable devices and mobile phones.
3	CES features several more key speeches from major technology players, such as Intel and Hewlett Packard, as well as parallel conference sessions on gaming, storage, broadband and the future of digital music.
3	About 50,000 new products will be unleashed at the tech-fest, which is the largest yet.
3	Consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers the CEA on Tuesday.
3	The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004.
3	That trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005.
3	GTA sequel is criminally good The Grand Theft Auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years, but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition.
3	The 18 certificate GTA: San Andreas for the PlayStation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach.
3	Instead, it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps, carefree, over all the Driv3r and True Crime-shaped opposition.
3	Even in the year that will see sequels to Halo and Half-Life, it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic.
3	The basic gameplay remains familiar.
3	You control a character, on this occasion a youth named CJ, who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive 3D environment.
3	CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane.
3	All come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family.
3	To make things worse, he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town, and blackmailed by crooked cops played by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn.
3	The setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional US state of San Andreas, comprising three major cities: Los Santos, which is a thinly-disguised Los Angeles, San Fierro, aka San Francisco and Las Venturas, a carbon copy of Las Vegas.
3	San Andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.
3	Its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold, assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since Vice City.
3	The streets, and vast swathes of countryside, are by turns gloriously menacing, grungy and preppy.
3	Flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail, the games overall look, particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets, is stupendous.
3	The outstanding bread-and-butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on.
3	Cars handle more convincingly than ever, a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds, and theres more traffic to navigate than before.
3	Park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway, and within seconds there will be a huge pile-up.
3	Pedestrians are also out in force, and are a loquacious bunch.
3	CJ can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad.
3	They will pass comments on his appearance and credibility, aspects that the player now has control over.
3	Clothes, tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased, and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool.
3	The character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym.
3	He will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up, but will swell up as a result of over-eating.
3	And at last, this is a GTA hero who can swim.
3	At a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, San Andreas violence, or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence, are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade.
3	Developers Rockstar have not shied away from brutality, and in some respects ramp it up from past outings.
3	When hijacking a car, for example, CJ will gratuitously shove the drivers head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle.
3	Indeed, the tone is darker than the jokey Vice City.
3	The grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game.
3	This title, incidentally, is set in 1992, but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists.
3	The wit is still present, just more restrained than in previous outings.
3	A further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options, where GTA games trademark humour is anchored.
3	The quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart.
3	The games rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed.
3	It is a testament to San Andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws, but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles dont detract.
3	The on-screen map, for instance, is needlessly fiddly, an unwelcome change from past editions.
3	There is also a very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments.
3	And the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre, setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission.
3	But the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive.
3	You simply will not be bothered by these minor failings.
3	San Andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.
3	BT offers free net phone calls BT is offering customers free internet telephone calls if they sign up to broadband in December.
3	The Christmas give-away entitles customers to free telephone calls anywhere in the UK via the internet.
3	Users will need to use BTs internet telephony software, known as BT Communicator, and have a microphone and speakers or headset on their PC.
3	BT has launched the promotion to show off the potential of a broadband connection to customers.
3	People wanting to take advantage of the offer will need to be a BT Together fixed-line customer and will have to sign up to broadband online.
3	The offer will be limited to the first 50,000 people who sign up and there are limitations - the free calls do not include calls to mobiles, non-geographical numbers such as 0870, premium numbers or international numbers.
3	BT is keen to provide extra services to its broadband customers.
3	People already using BT Communicator have found it by far the most convenient way of making a call if they are at their PC, said Andrew Burke, director of value-added services at BT Retail.
3	As more homes get high-speed access, providers are increasingly offering add-ons such as cheap net calls.
3	Broadband and telephony are attractive to customers and BT wants to make sure it is in the first wave of services, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.
3	BT Communicator had a quiet launch in the summer and now BT is waving the flag a bit more for it, he added.
3	BT has struggled to maintain its market share of broadband subscribers as more competitors enter the market.
3	Reports say that BT has lost around 10% of market share over the last year, down from half of broadband users to less than 40%.
3	BT is hoping its latest offer can persuade more people to jump on the broadband bandwagon.
3	It currently has 1.3 million broadband subscribers.
3	When invention turns to innovation It is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past.
3	When history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed peoples lives substantially.
3	But, says Nick Donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at IBM, it was not the thing itself that actually improved peoples lives.
3	It was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it.
3	The car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access.
3	When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st Century, we have to think more like this, but faster, Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website, after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering 2004 Hinton Lecture.
3	The invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had.
3	The equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered, but by themselves, they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did. These are not altogether new ideas, and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years.
3	But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.
3	We are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues Mr Donofrio, Industry Weeks 2003 Technology Leader of the Year.
3	The hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.
3	In the dotcom era, there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes.
3	Somebody had a new thing that would awe you.
3	You werent quite sure that it did anything, you werent quite sure if you needed it, you werent quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool. But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be in your face.
3	It will creep in pervasively.
3	Nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage.
3	I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure, says Mr Donofrio.
3	Pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards.
3	The net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there, like air.
3	People will not have to do anything to stay connected.
3	People will know their lives are just better, says Mr Donofrio.
3	Trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know. Natural interfaces will develop, devices will shape your persona, and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances.
3	Ultimately, there will be, says Mr Donofrio, no value in being computer illiterate.
3	To some, it sounds like a technological world gone mad.
3	To Mr Donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen.
3	Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing, says Mr Donofrio.
3	Deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data, and integral to this concept is supercomputing.
3	It has value, according to IBM, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates.
3	But pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world.
3	As computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration.
3	This is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience.
3	I am confident that the SET [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills, he says.
3	If I am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative.
3	Women tend to have those traits a lot better than men. Eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says.
3	In the UK, a DTI-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on SET industry boards.
3	IBM, according to Mr Donofrio, has 30%.
3	Our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career. The whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to Mr Donofrio.
3	We believe in the whole issue of global diversity, he says.
3	Our customers are diverse, our clients are diverse.
3	They expect us to look like them.
3	As more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them. Firefox browser takes on Microsoft Microsofts Internet Explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited Firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released.
3	Few people get excited when some new software is released, especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player.
3	But the release of the first full version of Firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour.
3	Fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the New York Times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available.
3	The release of Firefox 1.0 on 9 November might even cause a few heads to turn at Microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giants Internet Explorer browser.
3	Firefox has been created by the Mozilla Foundation which was started by former browser maker Netscape back in 1998.
3	Much of the development work done since then has gone into Firefox which made its first appearance under this name in February.
3	Earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called Phoenix and Firebird.
3	Since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in Microsofts Internet Explorer.
3	Rivals to IE got a boost in late June when two US computer security organisations warned people to avoid the Microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.
3	Internet monitoring firm WebSideStory has charted the growing population of people using the Firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of IE.
3	Before July this year, according to WebSideStory, Internet Explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers.
3	That figure had remained static for years.
3	In July the IE using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of October stood at 92.9%.
3	The Mozilla Foundation claims that Firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the Windows- using, net-browsing population.
3	Firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than Internet Explorer and has some innovations lacking in Microsofts program.
3	For instance, Firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them.
3	It blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.
3	One of the most powerful features of Firefox is the many hundreds of extras, or extensions, produced for it.
3	The Mozilla Foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program.
3	This has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar Google toolbar to a Homeland Security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels.
3	Firefox, which used to be called Firebird and before that Phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans.
3	A campaign co-ordinated by the Spread Firefox website attempted to raise the $50,000 needed for a full page advert in the New York Times.
3	The campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers.
3	Ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about $250,000 has been raised.
3	The ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late November/early December.
3	The surplus cash will be used to help keep the Mozilla Foundation running.
3	Microsoft is facing a growing challenge to IEs hold on the web using population.

3	Halo fans hope for sequel Xbox video game Halo 2 has been released in the US on 9 November, with a UK release two days later.
3	Why is the game among the most anticipated of all time? Halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel.
3	A science fiction epic, Halo centred the action on a human cyborg, controlled by the player, who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space.
3	Remembrance of Things Past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as Larry Nivens Ringworld and the film Starship Troopers, it fit the bill perfectly.
3	Halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive, had tremendous audio, using Dolby Digital, a decent storyline, instant playability and impressive physics.
3	But what marked Halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming.
3	Produced by Bungie software, renowned for their innovation in gaming, it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by Microsoft and became an Xbox exclusive.
3	Claude Errera, editor of fansite Halo.
3	Bungie.
3	Org, said: Bungie got everything right.
3	They were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to.
3	Nothing distracts you when you were playing.
3	There was nothing in Halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be. He added: Graphically it was superior to everything else out there.
3	It also had a depth to it that made it stand out. Halo was unusually immersive, sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller.
3	It also capitalised on the growing popularity of LAN gaming in the PC world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together, allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time.
3	The game instantly cultivated an online following, which continues today with a score of Halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel, Halo 2.
3	Errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website, which attracts 600,000 page views a day from Halo fans eager for the latest news.
3	When the Xbox launched on November 15 2001 in the US, Halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers.
3	Halo is the most important launch game for any console ever, wrote the influential Edge magazine in its review, giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark.
3	The game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game, it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since.
3	The first time I played it I just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun, said Errera, remarking on the level of detail in the game.
3	The game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game.
3	It blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of Halo, said Errera, referring to a fan who had created a video of Master Chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world.
3	Video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the games amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following.
3	Speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body.
3	When early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line.
3	Errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high.
3	It does not feel like a game release any more.
3	Somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in Microsofts history.
3	Were all just hoping that Bungie has got it right again. Halo 2 is out on 9 November in the US and 11 November in the UK Players sought for $1m prize UK gamers are getting a chance to take part in a $1m tournament thanks to one of the countrys top teams.
3	The Four-Kings clan is staging a Pop Idol type competition to find new members who can take on the worlds best in the lucrative tournament.
3	Four-Kings hopes the open qualifiers will turn up gamers good enough to beat all comers at the Painkiller game.
3	Top players also get a contract with the Four-Kings team which will pay travelling expenses for the contest.
3	UK gamers have until 12 November to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the Four-Kings, Jolt.
3	co.
3	uk and Painkiller tournament websites.
3	Philip Wride, who co-manages the Four-Kings team, said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 November to find the best eight players of the Painkiller game.
3	He said the clan was running the contest because Four-Kings does not currently have any players that excel at Painkiller.
3	These eight players will be brought together in London on 3-5 December for the Bloodline Tournament that will find the best two players.
3	The event will be filmed and the final cut made available online for others to watch.
3	The movie is being put together by Simon Bysshe who has shot many other films about pro-gaming that have been widely shared online.
3	Said Mr Bysshe: Painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up. Painkiller has been described as a game that adds a few modern touches, such as improved graphics, to the old-fashioned first-person shooter.
3	These two players will be put forward as the UKs entrants to the Cyberathlete Professional League $1m Painkiller contest that will take place throughout 2005.
3	The event is being billed as the CPL World Tour and will be arranged around ten separate tournaments at different locations around the world.
3	Travel expenses to all the stops on the tour will be paid by Four-Kings for the two UK players who make the grade.
3	The top prize at each stop on the world tour will be $15,000.
3	A further $150,000 will be given to the winner of the Grand Final due to be held in December 2005.
3	Mr Wride said any gamer that wins a few tour stop tournaments and the grand final will have a very good year.
3	The first stop on the world tour will be Istanbul, Turkey from 10-13 February.
3	A total of $50,000 in cash prizes is on offer.
3	The CPL has said that it picked a one-on-one game such as Painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action.
3	Counter-Strike, by far the most popular online game, pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played.
3	The decision to pick Painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers, as it was widely expected that Doom 3 would be chosen as the one-one-one title.
3	US top of supercomputing charts The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBMs prototype Blue Gene/L machine.
3	It is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy.
3	IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops.
3	The previous top machine, Japans NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86.
3	The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.
3	It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.
3	Once completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype.
3	Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat, said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list.
3	It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the USs nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing.
3	It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.
3	In second place was Silicon Graphics Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agencys (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California.
3	The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October.
3	It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering.
3	The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002.
3	It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.
3	Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.
3	The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second).
3	The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.
3	Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world.
3	It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.
3	Text messages aid disaster recovery Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia.
3	The messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation.
3	Now some are studying how the technology behind SMS could be better used during an emergency.
3	Sanjaya Senanayake works for Sri Lankan television.
3	The blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, Morquendi.
3	He was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the Sri Lankan coast.
3	Cell phone signals were weak.
3	Land lines were unreliable.
3	So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages.
3	The messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of who needs what and where.
3	Blogging friends in India took Mr Senanayakes text messages and posted them on a weblog called Dogs without Borders.
3	Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.
3	And thats when Mr Senanayake started to wonder if SMS might be put to more practical use.
3	SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call, he says.
3	In every rural community, theres at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages. Half a world away, in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, Taran Rampersad read Morquendis messages.
3	Mr Rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster.
3	He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help.
3	Mr Rampersad said: Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect.
3	He can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field. He added: Or, send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places. Mr Rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since Hurricane Ivan ravaged the Caribbean and the southern United States last September.
3	Last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia.
3	In only 72 hours, he found Dan Lane, a text message guru living in Britain.
3	The pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the Alert Retrieval Cache.
3	The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help.
3	This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people, says Paul Saffo, a director at the California-based Institute for the Future.
3	You may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace youre just one click or one e-mail away, he said, Thats put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because theyre not right on top of the tragedy. It is still very early days for the project, though.
3	In an e-mail, Dan Lane calls it an early proof of concept. Right now, the Alert Retrieval Cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list.
3	In the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages.
3	But theres still another challenge.
3	You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use.
3	Its amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what were trying to do and everything like that, says Mr Rampersad.
3	So the big problem right now is the same problem were trying to solve - human communication. He is optimistic, however.
3	He thinks that the Alert Retrieval Cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice.
3	And he stands by his motto, courtesy of Michelangelo: criticise by creating.
3	Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.
3	Putting a face to Big Brother Literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.
3	Imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails.
3	Basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist.
3	Together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future.
3	Some of these ideas have been showcased at the Londons Science Museum, as part of its Future Face exhibition.
3	One such avatar is Jeremiah.
3	It is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer.
3	His creator, Richard Bowden, lecturer at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey, refers to Jeremiah as him, rather than it.
3	Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity.
3	He is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus, he told the BBC News website.
3	When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them.
3	If you ignore him, he gets angry.
3	If you leave, he gets sad.
3	And you can also even surprise him. Jeremiah is not actually intelligent.
3	It works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system.
3	It is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet.
3	The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiahs next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: Finn the fish.
3	I am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch whats going on and make decisions based on that, explained Dr Bowden.
3	The research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.
3	Experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos.
3	If you get up at three oclock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea, said Dr Bowden.
3	Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on. You might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left.
3	This might sound like a scary vision of an Orwellian future.
3	But it might all depend on the face that is watching you.
3	When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them, said Dr Bowden.
3	But when Jeremiahs camera went in, nobody minded, because although its still watching them, they could see what it was watching. Football Manager scores big time For the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of Championship Manager (CM).
3	Indeed, it seems like there has been a CM game for as many years as there have been PCs.
3	However, last year was the final time that developers Sports Interactive (SI) and publishers Eidos would work together.
3	They decided to go their separate ways, and each kept a piece of the franchise.
3	SI kept the games code and database, and Eidos retained rights to the CM brand, and the look and feel of the game.
3	So at the beginning of this year, fans faced a new situation.
3	Eidos announced the next CM game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers Sega, under the name Football Manager.
3	So what does this mean? Well, Football Manager is the spiritual successor to the CM series, and it has been released earlier than expected.
3	At this point CM5 looks like it will ship early next year.
3	But given that Football Manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up? A game like FM2005 could blind you with statistics.
3	It has an obscene number of playable leagues, an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database, with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans.
3	But that does not do justice to the game really.
3	What we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the Earth.
3	You begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from, for instance England and Scotland.
3	That will give you a choice not just of the four main Scottish leagues, but the English Premiership all the way down to the Conference North and South.
3	Of course you might be looking for European glory, or to get hold of Abramovichs millions, in which case you can take control at Chelsea, or even Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan ... the list goes on a very long way.
3	Once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you.
3	Sometimes it is promotion, or a place in Europe, sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle.
3	It might even be a case of Champions or else.
3	Obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose, so choose wisely.
3	Then it is time to look at your squad, work out your tactics, seeing how much cash, if any, you have got to splash, having a look at the transfer market, sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it.
3	Then bring on the matches, which are once more available in the ever-improving top down 2D view.
3	With the exception of the improved user interface on the surface, not much else seems to have changed.
3	However, there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games, which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses.
3	The match engine is also much improved, and it is more of a joy than ever to watch.
3	In fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience.
3	With a game that is so complex and so open-ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases.
3	With so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area.
3	And a sport like football, which is so high profile and unpredictable itself, can never be modelled quite to everybodys satisfaction.
3	But this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only, and do not affect gameplay.
3	And if there are problems further down the line, Sports Interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible.
3	In all there are many more tweaks and improvements.
3	If you were a fan of the previous CM games, then FM2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it.
3	If you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take Margate into the Premiership, Spurs into Europe, or even putting Rangers back on the top of the tree, FM2005 could be the best purchase you ever made.
3	Just be warned that the family might not see you much at Christmas.
3	Football Manager 2005 out now for the PC and the Mac Musicians upbeat about the net Musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found.
3	The study by US researchers, Pew Internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing.
3	While most considered file-sharing as illegal, many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders.
3	Even successful artists dont think the lawsuits will benefit musicians, said report author Mary Madden.
3	For part of the study, Pew Internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians, songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between March and April 2004.
3	They ranged from full-time, successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music.
3	We looked at more of the independent musicians, rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry, Ms Madden told the BBC News website.
3	We always hear the views of successful artists like the Britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented. The survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet, rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood.
3	Almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration, with nine out of 10 going online to promote, advertise and post their music on the web.
3	More than 80% offered free samples online, while two-thirds sold their music via the net.
3	Independent musicians, in particular, saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly.
3	Musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically, said Ms Madden.
3	They are using the internet to gain inspiration, sell it online, tracking royalties, learning about copyright. Perhaps surprisingly, opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry.
3	Through the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music.
3	But the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the US.
3	It found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad, though most agreed that it should be illegal.
3	Free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing, said one musician quoted by the report.
3	Its hard to keep making records if they dont pay for themselves through sales. However 60% said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters.
3	Many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing, the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it.
3	Both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music, rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy, said Ms Madden.
3	Broadband takes on TV viewing The number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits, research suggests.
3	Just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts Nielsen/NetRatings.
3	The total number of people online in Europe has broken the 100 million mark.
3	The popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from TV, say analysts Jupiter Research.
3	It found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching TV in favour of the net The report by Nielsen/NetRatings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year.
3	The biggest jump was in Italy, where it rose by 120%.
3	Britain was close behind, with broadband users almost doubling in a year.
3	The growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans.
3	Twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in Europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing, said Gabrielle Prior, Nielsen/NetRatings analyst.
3	As the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones. The total number of Europeans online rose by 12% to 100 million over the past year, the report showed, with the biggest rise in France, Italy, Britain and Germany.
3	The ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time.
3	A study by analysts Jupiter Research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits.
3	In homes with broadband, 40% said they were spending less time watching TV.
3	The threat to TV was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the UK, France and Spain, said the report.
3	It said TV companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009.
3	Year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how Europes population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for TV, newspaper and radio, said Jupiter Research analyst Olivier Beauvillian.
3	Freeze on anti-spam campaign A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.
3	Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites.
3	But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words Stay tuned.
3	No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.
3	Lycos Europes Make love not spam campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes.
3	People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages.
3	Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites.
3	But the plan has proved controversial.
3	Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.
3	The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack.
3	In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them.
3	Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences.
3	Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold.
3	The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, Stay tuned.
3	The numerical internet address of the site has also changed.
3	This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site.
3	The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web.
3	Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism.
3	Attacking a spammers website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos.
3	Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up. ITunes user sues Apple over iPod A user of Apples iTunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an iPod to play songs.
3	He says Apple is breaking anti-competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site.
3	Apple, which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the iPod in 2001, uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the iPod.
3	Californian Thomas Slattery filed the suit in the US District Court in San Jose and is seeking damages.
3	Apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice, the lawsuit states.
3	The key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like iTunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market, according to Ernest Gellhorn, an anti-trust law professor at George Mason University.
3	As a practical matter, the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims, Prof Gellhorn said.
3	Apple has sold more than six million iPods since the gadget was launched and has an 87% share of the market for portable digital music players, market research firm NPD Group has reported.
3	More than 200 million songs have been sold by the iTunes music store since it was launched.
3	Apple has unlawfully bundled, tied, and/or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players, and vice-versa, the lawsuit said.
3	Mr Slattery called himself an iTunes customer who was also forced to purchase an Apple iPod if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to.
3	A spokesman for Apple declined to comment.
3	Apples online music store uses a different format for songs than Napster, Musicmatch, RealPlayer and others.
3	The rivals use the MP3 format or Microsofts WMA format while Apple uses AAC, which it says helps thwart piracy.
3	The WMA format also includes so-called Digital Rights Management which is used to block piracy.
3	Microsoft gets the blogging bug Software giant Microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging.
3	It is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs, or online journals, called MSN Spaces.
3	Microsoft is trailing behind competitors like Google and AOL, which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals.
3	Blogs, short for web logs, have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online.
3	MSN Spaces is free to anyone with a Hotmail or MSN Messenger account.
3	People will be able to choose a layout for the page, upload images and share photo albums and music playlists.
3	The service will be supported by banner ads.
3	This is a simple tool for people to express themselves, said MSNs Blake Irving.
3	This is Microsofts first foray into blogging, which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year.
3	Competitors like Google already offer free services through its Blogger site, while AOL provides its members with journals.
3	Accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by.
3	According to blog analysis firm Technorati, the so-called blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months.
3	It now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million, although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.
3	Broadband fuels online change Fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests.
3	A quarter of broadband users in Britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by UK think-tank Demos.
3	It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet.
3	More than five million households in the UK have broadband and that number is growing fast.
3	The Demos report looked at the impact of broadband on peoples net habits.
3	It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast.
3	One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web.
3	More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online.
3	It found that one in five post something on the net everyday, ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs.
3	Broadband is putting the me in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual, said John Craig, co-author of the Demos report.
3	From self-diagnosis to online education, broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed. The Demos report, entitled Broadband Britain: The End Of Asymmetry?, was commissioned by net provider AOL.
3	Broadband is moving the perception of the internet as a piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the UK, said Karen Thomson, Chief Executive of AOL UK, with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio. According to analysts Nielsen//NetRatings, more than 50% of the 22.8 million UK net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed They spend twice as long online than people on dial-up connections, viewing an average of 1,444 pages per month.
3	The popularity of fast net access is growing, partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services.
3	Blog picked as word of the year The term blog has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a US dictionary publisher.
3	Merriam-Webster said blog headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months.
3	During 2004 blogs, or web logs, have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media.
3	Other words on the Merriam-Webster list were associated with major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US.
3	Merriam-Webster defines a blog as: a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments and often hyperlinks.
3	Its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words, that everyone likes to look up, or those that always cause problems, such as affect and effect.
3	Merriam-Webster said blog was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months.
3	The word will now appear in the 2005 version of Merriam-Websters printed dictionary.
3	However, the word is already included in some printed versions of the Oxford English Dictionary.
3	A spokesman for the Oxford University Press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners, reflecting its mainstream use.
3	I think it was the word of last year rather than this year, he said.
3	Now were getting words that derive from it such as blogosphere and so on, he said.
3	But, he added, its a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days its got established very quickly. Blogs come in many different forms.
3	Many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects, some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites.
3	Other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the US, such as hurricane or were to do with the US election.
3	Words such as incumbent, electoral and partisan reflected the scale of interest in the vote.
3	Blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the US election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media.
3	Speculation that President Bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs.
3	Online journals also raised doubts about documents used by US television news organisation CBS in a story about President Bushs war record.
3	The immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press.
3	This is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny.
3	Statistics by web influence ranking firm HitWise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051% of all net visits per day.
3	One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online.
3	According to blog analysis firm Technorati the number of blogs in existence, the blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months.
3	Technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million.
3	Some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained.
3	According to US research firm Pew Internet & American Life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds.
3	Another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about.
3	In many repressive regimes and developing nations, blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.
3	New Years texting breaks record A mobile phone was as essential to the recent New Years festivities as a party mood and Auld Lang Syne, if the number of text messages sent is anything to go by.
3	Between midnight on 31 December and midnight on 1 January, 133m text messages were sent in the UK.
3	It is the highest ever daily total recorded by the Mobile Data Association (MDA).
3	It represents an increase of 20% on last years figures.
3	Wishing a Happy New Year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the years largest party.
3	While texting has not quite overtaken the old-fashioned phone call, it is heading that way, said Mike Short, chairman of the MDA.
3	In the case of a New Years Eve party, texting is useful if you are unable to speak or hear because of a noisy background, he said.
3	There were also lots of messages sent internationally, where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible, he said.
3	The British love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn, according to MDA.
3	The MDA predicts that 2005 could see more than 30bn text messages sent in the UK.
3	We thought texting might slow down as MMS took off but we have seen no sign of that, said Mr Short.
3	More and more firms are seeing the value in mobile marketing.
3	Restaurants are using text messages to tell customers about special offers and promotions.
3	Anyone in need of a bit of January cheer now the party season is over, can use a service set up by Jongleurs comedy club, which will text them a joke a day.
3	For those still wanting to drink and be merry as the long days of winter draw in, the Good Pub Guide offers a service giving the location and address of their nearest recommended pub.
3	Users need to text the word GOODPUB to 85130.
3	If they want to turn the evening into a pub crawl, they simply text the word NEXT.
3	And for those still standing at the end of the night, a taxi service in London is available via text, which will locate the nearest available black cab.
3	DS aims to touch gamers The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback.
3	Market leader Nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.
3	The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks.
3	Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype.
3	The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree.
3	Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive.
3	Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.
3	The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firms pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.
3	Nintendo first launched its GameBoy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since.
3	But its lead can no longer be taken for granted.
3	Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable, while start-up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.
3	We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill, said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europes general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld.
3	With its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points.
3	It went on sale in the US in mid-November priced $150 and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations, without giving detailed figures.
3	Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device.
3	With more than two million pre-orders for the device in Japan, Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot.
3	But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters - a 3D action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machines wireless capabilities.
3	It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.
3	The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim.
3	The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons.
3	It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating.
3	Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful re-creation of the Nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels.
3	The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine.
3	One thing is for certain.
3	Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers.
3	If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DSs key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up.
3	The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.
3	No half measures with Half-Life 2 Could Half-Life 2 possibly live up to the hype? After almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays its safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.
3	Fortunately, it doesnt merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it.
3	No-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long.
3	The impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped.
3	All the money - or indeed time - is on the screen.
3	The player sees things through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 Half-Life.
3	Having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, hes back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic City 17.
3	It has the look of a beautiful Eastern European city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, its clear that all is not well here.
3	Sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer.
3	A casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.
3	You are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task.
3	It is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged.
3	Finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about.
3	That does not really matter.
3	HL2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot.
3	Underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen.
3	There are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow.
3	Exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.
3	Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through Half-Lifes world truly does feel like being part of a movie.
3	Considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications.
3	But if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your PCs components, this is it.
3	On our test machine - an Alienware system with an Athlon 3500+ processor and ATIs Radeon X800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping.
3	It is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them.
3	The haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful.
3	Luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings.
3	So impressive are the physics that youll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move.
3	There are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force.
3	Freeman is quickly reunited with the original games famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.
3	Virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion.
3	You will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed.
3	At times Half-Life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome.
3	Running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun.
3	Human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones.
3	The stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles.
3	In gameplay terms, HL2 somehow gets almost everything perfect.
3	And without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of Doom III, its all incredibly unsettling.
3	The vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point I even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.
3	The game does have a couple of problems.
3	Firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.
3	A lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once youve completed it.
3	If you like things open-ended and free-ranging, Far Cry will be a lot more pleasing.
3	But the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run.
3	Installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saints patience.
3	Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.
3	The box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded.
3	The time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental Valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours.
3	It would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, Half-Life 2 is up to the challenge.
3	It is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre.
3	The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.
3	Half-Life 2 is out now for the PC Games win for Blu-ray DVD format The next-generation DVD format Blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival, according to its backers.
3	Blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including Sony, is competing against Toshiba and NEC-backed HD-DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games.
3	The Blu-Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format.
3	The next generation of DVDs will hold high-definition video and sound.
3	This offers incredible 3D-like quality of pictures which major Hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year.
3	In a separate press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Toshiba announced that DVD players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.
3	As we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images, we have a much greater need for storage, Richard Doherty, from Panasonics Hollywood Laboratories, one of the pioneers of Blu-ray, told the BBC news website.
3	So by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as todays DVD. A Blu-ray disc will be able to store 50GB of high-quality data, while Toshibas HD-DVD will hold 30GB.
3	Mr Doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the DVDs and smaller discs to fit into camcorders.
3	Both Toshiba and Blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging DVD format war, akin to the Betamax and VHS fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation DVD players start to come out.
3	When players do come out, they will be able to play standard DVDs too, which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current DVDs.
3	But the support from Vivendi and Electronics Arts is a big boost to Blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.
3	Gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide, so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made.
3	The technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies, said Michael Heilmann, chief technology officer for Vivendi Universal.
3	Blu-ray offers the capacity, performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming. EA, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and Blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning.
3	Sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of PlayStations.
3	Mr Doherty said gamers were ravenous for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.
3	Gamers, especially those working on PCs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback. He added: The focus for games moving forward on increased immersion.
3	Gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3D models and textures and increasing the resolution, increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience. Fitting these models on current DVD technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost.
3	As games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting.
3	They are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments, said Mr Doherty.
3	Currently, graphics-intensive PC games also require multiple discs for installation.
3	High-definition DVDs will cut down on that need.
3	Likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so DVDs that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games.
3	Blu-ray has already won backing from major Hollywood studios, such as MGM Studios, Disney, and Buena Vista, as well as top technology firms like Dell, LG, Samsung and Phillips amongst others.
3	While Toshibas HD-DVD technology has won backing from Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros.
3	The real world benefits (of HD-DVD) are apparent and obvious, said Jim Cardwell, president of Warner Home Video.
3	Mr Cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with HD-DVD.
3	Both formats are courting Microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation Xbox, but discussions are still on-going.
3	Next generation DVDs will also be able to store images and other data.
3	CES is the largest consumer electronics show in the world, and runs from 6 to 9 January.
3	File-swappers ready new network Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.
3	One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program.
3	A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January.
3	But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies.
3	In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network.
3	The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised.
3	That file-sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for.
3	Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network.
3	One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.
3	org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to.
3	Now the man behind suprnova.
3	org, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed Exeem.
3	In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems.
3	Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want.
3	Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone.
3	There will be no centrally maintained list.
3	This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music.
3	The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users.
3	An early public version of the software should be available before February.
3	Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development.
3	There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version.
3	He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program.
3	Despite Suprnova administrator Slonceks involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis.
3	Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream.
3	Dr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems.
3	But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.
3	Exeem cannot prevent pollution, he said.
3	The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings, he said.
3	Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes.
3	By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality.
3	The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one thats full of crap like Kazaa, he said.
3	There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity, he said.
3	Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading.
3	When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse.
3	He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic.
3	Its hard to compete with free, he said.
3	No-one from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.
3	Online games play with politics After bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.
3	The US presidential election provided a showcase for many, aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads.
3	Experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society.
3	The first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the Iowa Game, commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean.
3	More than 20 followed suit, including Frontrunner, eLections, President Forever and The Political Machine, which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign, including having to cope with the media.
3	Others helped raise the stakes during the Bush/Kerry contest by highlighting a candidates virtues or his vices.
3	The phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.
3	When I started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen, said Gonzalo Frasca, computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen.
3	I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved, added the Uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns.
3	Many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.
3	com.
3	The aim is to comment on international news events via games.
3	The ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way.
3	Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation, Mr Frasca told the BBC News website.
3	This was the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay, Cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the countrys problems could be solved by working together.
3	Its up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games. Ultimately, Dr Frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes, fears and beliefs.
3	Children learn a lot about the world through play.
3	There is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up. But experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.
3	This is hardly surprising, compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web.
3	Only a few years ago, most politicians did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have.
3	Dr Frasca said: Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games.
3	They represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them. It will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns. Broadband challenges TV viewing The number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits, research suggests.
3	Just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts Nielsen/NetRatings.
3	The total number of people online in Europe has broken the 100 million mark.
3	The popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from TV, say analysts Jupiter Research.
3	It found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching TV in favour of the net The report by Nielsen/NetRatings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year.
3	The biggest jump was in Italy, where it rose by 120%.
3	Britain was close behind, with broadband users almost doubling in a year.
3	The growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans.
3	Twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in Europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing, said Gabrielle Prior, Nielsen/NetRatings analyst.
3	As the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones. The total number of Europeans online rose by 12% to 100 million over the past year, the report showed, with the biggest rise in France, Italy, Britain and Germany.
3	The ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time.
3	A study by analysts Jupiter Research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits.
3	In homes with broadband, 40% said they were spending less time watching TV.
3	The threat to TV was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the UK, France and Spain, said the report.
3	It said TV companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009.
3	Year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how Europes population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for TV, newspaper and radio, said Jupiter Research analyst Olivier Beauvillian.
3	Freeze on anti-spam campaign A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.
3	Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites.
3	But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words Stay tuned.
3	No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.
3	Lycos Europes Make love not spam campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes.
3	People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages.
3	Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites.
3	But the plan has proved controversial.
3	Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.
3	The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack.
3	In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them.
3	Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences.
3	Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold.
3	The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, Stay tuned.
3	The numerical internet address of the site has also changed.
3	This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site.
3	The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web.
3	Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism.
3	Attacking a spammers website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos.
3	Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up. Halo 2 sells five million copies Microsoft is celebrating bumper sales of its Xbox sci-fi shooter, Halo 2.
3	The game has sold more than five million copies worldwide since it went on sale in mid-November, the company said.
3	Halo 2 has proved popular online, with gamers notching up a record 28 million hours playing the game on Xbox Live.
3	According to Microsoft, nine out of 10 Xbox Live members have played the game for an average of 91 minutes per session.
3	The sequel to the best-selling Need for Speed: Underground has inched ahead of the competition to take the top slot in the official UK games charts.
3	The racing game moved up one spot to first place, nudging GTA: San Andreas down to second place.
3	Halo 2 dropped one place to five, while Half-Life 2 fell to number nine.
3	Last weeks new releases, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent and Killzone, both failed to make it into the top 10, debuting at number 11 and 12 respectively.
3	Record numbers of Warcraft fans are settling in the games online world.
3	On the opening day of the World of Warcraft massive multi-player online game more than 200,000 players signed up to play.
3	On the evening of the first day more than 100,000 players were in the world, forcing Blizzard to add another 34 servers to cope with the influx.
3	The online game turns the stand alone Warcraft games into a persistent world that players can inhabit not just visit Europes gamers could be waiting until January to hear when they can get their mitts on Nintendos handheld device, Nintendo DS, says gamesindustry.
3	biz.
3	David Yarnton, Nintendo UK general manager, told a press conference to look out for details in the New Year.
3	Its US launch was on Sunday and it goes on sale in Japan on 2 December.
3	Nintendo has a 95% share of the handheld gaming market and said it expected to sell around five million of the DS by March 2005.
3	When technology gets personal In 2020, whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;.
3	By then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says Ian Pearson, BTs resident futurologist.
3	Its all part of whats known as a pervasive ambient world, where chips are everywhere.
3	Mr Pearson does not have a crystal ball.
3	His job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future.
3	Inanimate objects will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets, in homes, in appliances, on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that think.
3	Forget local area networks - these will be body area networks.
3	Ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around.
3	Images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology.
3	But now a new vision is surfacing, where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality, form, or aesthetics.
3	Such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.
3	So MP3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into ones clothing, says Mr Pearson.
3	So the gadgets that fill up your handbag, when we integrate those into fabric, we can actually get rid of all that stuff.
3	You wont necessarily see the electronics. Wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while video tattoos, or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as TV screens for those on the move.
3	However, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions.
3	If technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says Baroness Susan Greenfield.
3	At a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the Royal Society in London, neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield cautioned we cant just sleepwalk into the future.
3	Yet this technology is already upon us.
3	Researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing.
3	MP3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops.
3	These smart fabrics have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale.
3	At the nanoscale, materials can be tuned to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster, lighter, stronger and more efficient devices and systems.
3	The textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways.
3	Many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine, defence, healthcare, sports, and communications.
3	Professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin.
3	Nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2) coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties.
3	These have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or UV light.
3	Such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance, to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces, and applied to windows so they clean themselves.
3	Dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin.
3	But Baroness Greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being.
3	If our clothing, skin, and personal body networks do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy.
3	Mr Pearson picks up the theme, pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become cyborgian.
3	His main concern is privacy.
3	We are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really dont want every passer-by to know.
3	So we have to make sure we build security in this.
3	If you are wearing smart make-up, where electronics are controlling the appearance, you dont want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead. As technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently? We cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this, warns Baroness Greenfield.
3	There have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards.
3	This paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers.
3	Clearly, the organic, carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging.
3	The cyborg - a very familiar part-human, part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.
3	Microsoft gets the blogging bug Software giant Microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging.
3	It is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs, or online journals, called MSN Spaces.
3	Microsoft is trailing behind competitors like Google and AOL, which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals.
3	Blogs, short for web logs, have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online.
3	MSN Spaces is free to anyone with a Hotmail or MSN Messenger account.
3	People will be able to choose a layout for the page, upload images and share photo albums and music playlists.
3	The service will be supported by banner ads.
3	This is a simple tool for people to express themselves, said MSNs Blake Irving.
3	This is Microsofts first foray into blogging, which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year.
3	Competitors like Google already offer free services through its Blogger site, while AOL provides its members with journals.
3	Accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by.
3	According to blog analysis firm Technorati, the so-called blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months.
3	It now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million, although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.
3	Doors open at biggest gadget fair Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).
3	The fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year.
3	About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds.
3	Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.
3	The thrust of this years show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere.
3	About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet.
3	Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies.
3	The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others.
3	The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them, Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website.
3	It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters. Consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday.
3	The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004.
3	Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004.
3	That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005.
3	The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players.
3	This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house.
3	Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere, said Mr Joseph.
3	He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the democratisation of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images.
3	There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apples iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.
3	The CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year.
3	Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women.
3	Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsofts Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales.
3	Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote.
3	Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead.
3	With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace.
3	Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005.
3	Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are.
3	This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards.
3	CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.
3	Who do you think you are? The real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net, argues analyst Bill Thompson.
3	It is what happens when it arrives at the other end.
3	The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data.
3	The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities.
3	Armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone elses name.
3	And it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving.
3	Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills, receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.
3	But, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble.
3	It is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system.
3	In fact, I suspect that the FSA is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time.
3	Has anyone checked Bob Cratchits family links to the criminal underworld, I wonder? And it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted.
3	Health authorities, government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like Amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters.
3	The good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to.
3	And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details.
3	Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files.
3	Companies like SecureWave, for example, can restrict the use of USB ports just to authorised devices or even to an individuals personal memory card.
3	These solutions are not perfect, but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system.
3	However the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office.
3	It has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked.
3	In fact I do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.
3	There are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud.
3	CD Universe, Powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences.
3	And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name.
3	Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused? Any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it.
3	Unauthorised disclosure is not allowed, but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the Act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice.
3	This is not something we can just leave it to the market.
3	The consequences of having ones identity stolen are too serious, and markets respond too slowly.
3	After all, I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems.
3	I doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future.
3	The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft.
3	I have never felt comfortable with the US practice of suing everything that moves, partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients, so I know which Id prefer.
3	Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.
3	Brainwave cap controls computer A team of US researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.
3	Four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes.
3	Previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain.
3	The New York team reported their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
3	The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions, said Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane.
3	The research team, from New York State Department of Health and State University of New York in Albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.
3	The four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed.
3	Brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes.
3	Complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer.
3	Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively.
3	The impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis, said the researchers.
3	The four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried.
3	Although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated.
3	It is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments.
3	Some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques.
3	Earlier this year, a team at the MIT Media Labs Europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.

3	Europe backs digital TV lifestyle How people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious European project.
3	In Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative.
3	Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback.
3	The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme.
3	More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica.
3	It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together.
3	But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working.
3	A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.
3	The European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach.
3	They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses.
3	The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are.
3	Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them.
3	What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget.
3	This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer.
3	Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes.
3	Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms.
3	With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the worlds dominant DRM scheme is huge.
3	Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home.
3	The 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years.
3	Simon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media A decade of good website design The web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago.
3	Back in 1994, Yahoo had only just launched, most websites were text-based and Amazon, Google and eBay had yet to appear.
3	But, says usability guru Dr Jakob Nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use.
3	Dr Nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today.
3	Roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today, he said.
3	Some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed. Some design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said Dr Nielsen.
3	But theres great stability on usability concerns, he told the BBC News website.
3	Dr Nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a sites total design, were as important as ever.
3	Its necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such, he said.
3	They are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would.
3	A lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off, he said.
3	But there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband. Dr Nielsen said the success of sites such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important.
3	Those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful, said Dr Nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.
3	All are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet, he said.
3	They are making simple but powerful tools available to the user.
3	None of them have a fancy or glamorous look, he added, declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied.
3	In the future, Dr Nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online.
3	They are becoming like the operating system to the internet, he said.
3	But, he said, the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better.
3	Currently, he said, search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries.
3	Often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not.
3	Tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results.
3	Research by Dr Nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines.
3	The latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that, on average, they use 2.2 terms.
3	In 1994 only 1.3 words were used.
3	I think its amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms, said Dr Nielsen.
3	You can hear more from Jakob Nielsen and web design on the BBC World Service programme, Go Digital 2D Metal Slug offers retro fun Like some drill sergeant from the past, Metal Slug 3 is a wake-up call to todays gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.

3	It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.
3	Players must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.
3	The shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius.
3	Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware.
3	Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq.
3	Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls, and while this is a tough nut to crack, it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go.
3	And at a mere £20, Metal Slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says.
3	Of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters.
3	But at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation, Metal Slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the Xbox was not even a twinkle in Bill Gates eye.
3	Casual gaming to take off Games aimed at casual players are set to be even bigger in 2005, according to industry experts.
3	Easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year.
3	The trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting, games console titles, which appeal more to hardcore gamers, said a panel of experts.
3	They were speaking before the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005.
3	The panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women, a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics.
3	Casual games like poker, pool, bridge, bingo and puzzle-based titles, which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices, were gender neutral and different genres attracted different players.
3	Greg Mills, program director at AOL, said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted 90% of 18 to 24-year-old males, while puzzle games were played by 80% of females.
3	Games like bridge tended to attract the over-50 demographic of gamers.
3	But hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec PCs, like Half-Life 2, or Halo 2 on Xbox, also liked to have a different type of gaming experience.
3	When hardcore gamers are not playing Halo, they are playing poker and pool, based on our research, said Geoff Graber, director of Yahoo Games, which attracts about 12 million gamers a month.
3	With the growth of powerful PC technology and ownership, broadband take-up, portable players and mobile devices, as well as interactive TV, casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005, according to the panel.
3	The focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles, they agreed.
3	We are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger, said Mr Graber.
3	Casual games will get into their stride in 2005, will be really big in 2006 and will be about community. With more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections, casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people.
3	Key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked.
3	Portal sites which offer casual games, like AOL, Yahoo, and RealArcade, as well as other games-on-demand services, allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people.
3	This aspect of community is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in £30 to £40 console or PC titles, said the panel.
3	About 120,000 people are expected to attend the CES trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and which officially runs from 6 to 9 January.
3	The main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other, allowing people to enjoy digital content, like audio, video and images, when they want, and where they want.
3	Ultimate game award for Doom 3 Sci-fi shooter Doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony, the Golden Joystick awards.
3	It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas.
3	The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August.
3	Other winners included Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which took the Most Wanted for Christmas prize.
3	Only released last week, it was closely followed by Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month.
3	But they missed out on the prize for the Most Wanted game of 2005, which went to the Nintendo title, The Legend of Zelda.
3	The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics.
3	It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter.
3	Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (£8.3m).
3	The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam.
3	The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004.
3	Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week.
3	It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time.
3	Electronic Arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from Nintendo which won in 2003.
3	The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines.
3	Games awards like this have grown in importance.
3	Over the last six years, the UK market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record £1,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts Screen Digest.
3	Gadget show heralds MP3 Christmas Partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this Christmas.
3	With Apples iPod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough iPod minis to go round, predicts Oliver Irish, editor of gadget magazine Stuff.
3	The iPod mini is likely to be this years Tracey Island, said Mr Irish.
3	Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one.
3	For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend.
3	Star of the show will be Sonys Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations.
3	But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot.
3	He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan.
3	He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him, said Mr Irish.
3	Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface.
3	The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple.
3	Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish.
3	Demand is huge and Apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on iPod minis, said Mr Irish.
3	For those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented, the Gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with GPS and GPRS, that also doubles up as an MP3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must-have.
3	What is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them, said Mr Irish.
3	This Christmas, gadgets will not be an all-male preserve.
3	Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves, said Mr Irish.
3	Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks. Supercomputer breaks speed record The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBMs prototype Blue Gene/L machine.
3	It is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab.
3	DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops.
3	The current top machine, Japans NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86.
3	Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world.
3	It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.
3	The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.
3	The US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark.
3	Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/Ls position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries.
3	But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement.
3	Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.
3	The IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005.
3	Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks.
3	It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.
3	The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the USs nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing.
3	The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002.
3	It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.
3	But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulators performance.
3	This was achieved during internal testing at IBMs production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record.
3	Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics Columbia supercomputer based at Nasas Ames Research Center in California.
3	It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering.
3	The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.
3	Supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society.
3	Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis.
3	IBMs senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing.
3	This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second.
3	When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world, Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.
3	You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative. One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health.
3	He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding.
3	Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures.
3	We are a great believer in simulation.
3	It gives you another tool, he said.
3	Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively.
3	Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact.
3	Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.
3	The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second).
3	The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.
3	Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world.
3	It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.
3	Gadgets galore on show at fair The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geeks paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.
3	Top gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics.
3	The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005.
3	One of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files.
3	The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help.
3	The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket.
3	It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool, said Seagate.
3	It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality. It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy, it said.
3	In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures.
3	Universal Electronics NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house.
3	It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems.
3	Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface.
3	Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices.
3	He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home.
3	The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girls Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering.
3	The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425).
3	Hotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair.
3	The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own space.
3	It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs.
3	We found that kids love playing in surround sound, said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat.
3	We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one. The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers.
3	And a drinks holder.
3	The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211).
3	Satellite radio is big business in the US.
3	In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology.
3	Eton Corporations Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US.
3	DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology.
3	It is for the risqu&#233; consumer, said an Eton spokesperson.
3	We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer. The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK.
3	In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133).
3	The average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES.
3	This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years time.
3	One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyos tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner.
3	It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device.
3	It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera.
3	Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months.
3	A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills.
3	The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb.
3	Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too.
3	Wearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design.
3	MPIOs tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good.
3	Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck.
3	Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends.
3	An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music.
3	The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.
3	Broadband in the UK growing fast High-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever.
3	BT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter.
3	The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million.
3	Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband.
3	Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe.
3	According to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people.
3	The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands.
3	The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name.
3	Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UKs most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.
3	Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds.
3	The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available.
3	This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas, said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell.
3	BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers.
3	This was a slight increase on the previous three months.
3	Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors.
3	Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customers home or office, is growing steadily.
3	Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services.
3	By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.
3	Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange.
3	There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.
3	US duo in first spam conviction A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers.
3	It is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors.
3	Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500.
3	They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses.
3	They will be formally sentenced next year.
3	A third defendant, Richard Rutkowski, was acquitted.
3	Prosecutors said Jaynes was a snake oil salesman in a new format, using the internet to peddle useless wares, news agency Associated Press reported.
3	A Fed-Ex refund processor was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home.
3	Another item on sale was an internet history eraser.
3	His sister helped him process credit card payments.
3	Jaynes amassed a fortune of $24m from his sales, prosecutors said.
3	Hes been successful ripping people off all these years, AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying.
3	Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said.
3	Prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for Jaynes, and a jail term for his sister.
3	But Jaynes lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term outrageous and said his client believed he was innocent.
3	He pointed out that all three of the accused lived in North Carolina and were unaware of the Virginia state law.
3	Spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60% of all e-mails sent.
3	Microsoft debuts security tools Microsoft is releasing tools that clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware.
3	The virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software.
3	Also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer.
3	Although initially free it is thought that soon Microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool.
3	The anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month.
3	Microsofts Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited.
3	It has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence.
3	Latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week.
3	Spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers, often without users knowledge.
3	In its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings.
3	The most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make.
3	Surveys have shown that most PCs are infested with spyware.
3	Research by technology firms Earthlink and Webroot revealed that 90% of Windows machine have the malicious software on board and, on average, each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs.
3	Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others.
3	It said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs.
3	On spyware freely available programs such as Ad-Aware and Spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay.
3	Microsofts two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years.
3	In 2003 it bought Romanian firm GeCAD Software to get hold of its anti-virus technology.
3	In December 2004 it bought New York-based anti-spyware firm Giant Company Software.
3	Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.
3	Slimmer PlayStation triple sales Sony PlayStation 2s slimmer shape has proved popular with UK gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale.
3	Sales have tripled since launch, outstripping Microsofts Xbox, said market analysts Chart-Track.
3	The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
3	The title broke the UK sales record for video games in its first weekend of release.
3	Latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677,000 copies.
3	It is obviously very, very encouraging for Sony because Microsoft briefly outsold them last week, John Houlihan, editor of Computerandvideogames.
3	com told BBC News.
3	And with Halo 2 [for Xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and Xbox. Although Xbox sales over the last week also climbed, PS2 sales were more than double that.
3	The figures mean Sony is reaching the seven million barrier for UK sales of the console.
3	Edinburgh-based developer, Rockstar, which is behind the GTA titles, has seen San Andreas pull in an estimated £24m in gross revenues over the weekend.
3	In comparison, blockbuster films like Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban took £11.5m in its first three days at the UK box office.
3	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King took nearly £10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets.
3	Gangster-themed GTA San Andreas is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto Vice City which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever.
3	The Xbox game Halo 2, released on 11 November in the UK, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year.
3	The original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies.
3	Mr Houlihan added that Sony had done well with the PS2, but it definitely helped that the release of San Andreas coincided with the slimline PS2 hitting the shelves.
3	The run-up to Christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles.
3	Microsofts Xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales.
3	The sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since GTA San Andreas has an 18 certificate.
3	Sony and Microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005.
3	Both have hit crucial price points at around £100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales, said Mr Houlihan.
3	Seamen sail into biometric future The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.
3	As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ships crew is testing prototype versions of the worlds first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarers equivalent of a passport.
3	Along with the owners picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holders fingerprints.
3	The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers Identity Documents of June 2003.
3	Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards.
3	Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November.
3	Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.
3	Authenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards.
3	If youre issued a seafarers ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed, Authenti-corps CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBCs Go Digital programme.
3	She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention.
3	It aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea.
3	The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailors wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans.
3	By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world, said Ms Musselman.
3	It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers. US blogger fired by her airline A US airline attendant suspended over inappropriate images on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired.
3	Ellen Simonetti, known as Queen of the Sky, wrote an anonymous semi-fictional account of her life in the sky.
3	She was suspended by Delta in September.
3	In a statement, she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for wrongful termination.
3	A Delta spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that Ms Simonetti was no longer an employee.
3	Delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls internal employee matters.
3	A spokesperson reiterated this position on Wednesday, confirming only that Ms Simonetti was no longer with the company.
3	The spokesperson also confirmed that there were very clear rules attached to the unauthorised use of Delta branding, including uniforms.
3	Ms Simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 November.
3	She said in an official statement: As a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by Delta Airlines I am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the Federal Government EEOC [US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]. She added she had also hired a Texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages. Ms Simonetti told the BBC News website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 September.
3	Queen of the Sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the BBC News website and others.
3	Her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites.
3	The blog, which she started in January as a way of getting over her mothers death, contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts.
3	Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti.
3	In the postings, she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity.
3	But some postings contained images of herself in uniform.
3	Of the 10 or so images only one showed Ms Simonettis flight wings.
3	She removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension.
3	I never meant it as something to harm my company and dont understand how they think it did harm them, Ms Simonetti said.
3	A legal expert in the US speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted.
3	Delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition.
3	It has said it needs to cut between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs and reduce costs by $5bn (£2.7bn) a year.
3	Analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention.
3	Last week, it struck a $1bn cost-cutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy.
3	The deal would see pilots accept a 32% pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million Delta shares, unions said.
3	And on Monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007.
3	The airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from American Express.
3	Mobiles double up as bus tickets Mobiles could soon double up as travel cards, with Nokia planning to try out a wireless ticket system on German buses.
3	Early next year travellers in the city of Hanau, near Frankfurt, will be able to pay for tickets by passing their phone over a smart-card reader already installed on the buses.
3	Passengers will need to own a Nokia 3220 handset which will have a special shell attached to it.
3	The system would reduce queues and make travelling easier, said Nokia.
3	Transport systems around the world are seeing the advantage of using ticketless smartcards.
3	Using a mobile phone is the next step, said Gerhard Romen, head of market development at Nokia.
3	The ticketless trial will start early in 2005 and people will also be able to access transport information and timetables via their phones.
3	Nokia has worked with electronics giant Philips to develop a shell for the mobile phone that will be compatible with Hanaus existing ticketing system.
3	The system opens up possibilities for mobile devices to be interact with everyday environments, said Mr Romen.
3	It could be used in shops to get product information, at bus-stops to get information about the next bus or, for example, by being passed over an advert of a rock star to find out details of concerts or get ringtones, he told the BBC News website.
3	He is confident that the trial being run in Germany could be extended to transport systems in other countries.
3	The technology offers access to a lot of services and makes it easy to get the information you want, he said.
3	Mobile gig aims to rock 3G Forget about going to a crowded bar to enjoy a gig by the latest darlings of the music press.
3	Now you could also be at a live gig on your mobile, via the latest third generation (3G) video phones.
3	Rock outfit Rooster are playing what has been billed as the first ever concert broadcast by phone on Tuesday evening from a London venue.
3	The 45-minute gig is due to be phone cast by the 3G mobile phone operator, 3.
3	3G technology lets people take, watch and send video clips on their phones, as well as swap data much faster than with 2G networks like GSM.
3	People with 3G phones in the UK can already download football and music clips on their handsets.
3	Some 1,000 fans of the London-based band will have to pay five pounds for a ticket and need a 3G handset.
3	Once you have paid, you can come and go as much as you like, because we expect the customers to be mobile, said 3 spokesperson Belinda Henderson.
3	Its like going to a concert hall, except that you are virtually there. The company behind the trial hopes to learn more about how people use their video phones.
3	We are looking on how long people will stay on average on the streams.
3	Some people may stay the whole time, some may dip in and out, said Ms Henderson.
3	We actually expect people to dip in and out because they are mobile and they will be doing other things. 3 is looking to music as a way of persuading more people to take up the latest video phones.
3	It is already planning regular gigs throughout 2005.
3	And during the intermission, of course, you would still be able to make a phone call.
3	Consumers snub portable video Consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report.
3	Produced by Jupiter Research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of Europeans want to watch video while out and about.
3	By contrast, almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an iPod.
3	The firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible.
3	The report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europes portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two.
3	Barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies.
3	Only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video.
3	Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices, said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst.
3	Mr Fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device.
3	Europeans care most about music playback, he said.
4	Mido makes third apology Ahmed Mido Hossam has made another apology to the Egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team.
4	The 21-year-old told a news conference in Cairo on Sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the Pharaohs since July last year.
4	Mido said: There isnt much I have to say today, all there is to say is that I came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes. Mido was axed by former coach Marco Tardelli after failing to answer a national call-up, claiming he had a groin injury.
4	But he then played in a friendly for his club AS Roma within 24 hours of a World Cup qualifying match at home to Cameroon last September.
4	Mido added: Its not my right to give orders and say when I want to play ... at the same time I will always make sure that I put the nationals teams matches as my top priority.
4	I feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as I saw them play against Belgium (Egypt won 4-0 on Wednesday) and I simply want to add to their success.
4	I do confess that I was rude to the Egyptian press at times but now I have gained more experience and know that I will never go anywhere without the presss support.
4	Many of the international stars like David Beckham and (Zinedine) Zidane had the press opposing them.
4	So Im now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and I dont have to overreact when this happens.
4	Meanwhile, Egypt FA spokesman Methat Shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on Mido to apologise.
4	Midos apology today does not negatively affect Mido in anyway, on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players, Shalaby said.
4	Shalaby earlier said that after an apology Mido would be available for the national side if coach Hassan Shehata chose him.
4	Mido joined Tottenham in an 18-month loan deal near the end of the January transfer window, scoring twice on his debut against Portsmouth.
4	Man City 0-2 Man Utd Manchester United reduced Chelseas Premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over Manchester City.
4	Wayne Rooney met Gary Nevilles cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off Richard Dunne, to put United ahead.
4	Seven minutes later, the unfortunate Dunne hooked a volley over David James head and into his own net.
4	Steve McManaman wasted Citys best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half.
4	In the opening 45 minutes United had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching Chelsea in the title race.
4	Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a Paul Scholes header over the bar.
4	And City seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern.
4	Only Shaun Wright-Phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony, looking lively down the right and causing Gabriel Heinze problems.
4	Wes Brown also found Wright-Phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline.
4	Wright-Phillips sublime skill and pace took him past Brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of McManaman.
4	But the former Liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against United by side-footing the easy chance wide.
4	John OShea was forced off after an earlier clash with Sylvain Distin and Cristiano Ronaldo came on to replace him.
4	He immediately caused Ben Thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the United attack.
4	Rooney was being well marshalled by Dunne - but that was all about to change.
4	After the break, United poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play.
4	And when Neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of Citys best first-half chance, Rooney showed McManaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of Dunnes leg.
4	Worse was to come for Dunne, who had been having a fine match.
4	On 75 minutes, he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear Rooneys cross and United seemed home and dry.
4	However, City did fight back and Fowler missed another great chance from close range.
4	And United keeper Roy Carroll saved well from Kiki Musampa.
4	But United could have a had a third late on when substitute Ryan Giggs hit the post.
4	- Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan: We had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.
4	We started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much.
4	But we still had four good chances, two after wed gone 2-0 down, the one McManaman missed was very similar to the one Wayne Rooney scored from. - Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson: It wasnt our best performance of the last three months but I think were deserved winners.
4	At times, especially in the first half, we didnt play with enough speed.
4	But with (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Ryan) Giggs on, the speed improved.
4	Derby games can be like that, they can be scrappy, dull, horrible and it was maybe like that. Man City: James, Mills (Bradley Wright-Phillips 83), Dunne, Distin, Thatcher, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Barton (Macken 68), Sibierski, McManaman, Musampa, Fowler.

4	Gerrard plays down European hopes Steven Gerrard has admitted that Liverpool have little chance of winning the Champions League this season.
4	The 24-year-old Reds skipper spoke out ahead of Tuesdays first leg at home to Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16, which he will miss through suspension.
4	Lets be realistic, there are some fantastic teams left in the Champions League, he told BBC Radio Five Live.
4	We are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year. Gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in Europes premier club competition.
4	Last season he described qualification for the Champions League as the be all and end all - and rumours persist that he will leave Anfield if the Reds fail to secure a place in the competition.
4	He has consistently been linked with a move away from Liverpool, with Chelsea the favourites to snap up the England midfielder.
4	And Blues boss Jose Mourinho backed Gerrards view that Rafael Benitezs team could struggle to progress this season.
4	Rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team, maybe hes a little bit behind (right now), he told BBC Radio Five Live.
4	Gerrard, who fired Liverpool into the last 16 of this seasons competition with a brilliant goal in Decembers win over Olympiakos, insisted he was still fully focused on helping Liverpool to glory this season.
4	The Reds are currently fifth in the Premiership table, five points off the crucial fourth spot, which brings Champions League qualification - and they face Chelsea in Sundays Carling Cup final.
4	Its big couple of months for Liverpool, he added.
4	Were fighting for the fourth spot for the Champions League for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions, which are very important.
4	We are confident we can upset Chelsea in the Carling Cup final and get to the last eight of the Champions League because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good. Duff ruled out of Barcelona clash Chelseas Damien Duff has been ruled out of Wednesdays Champions League clash with Barcelona at the Nou Camp.
4	Duff sustained a knee injury in the FA Cup defeat at Newcastle and manager Jose Mourinho said: He cannot run.
4	His injury is very painful, so he is out. But Mourinho has revealed defender Willian Gallas and striker Didier Drogba will be in the starting line-up.
4	The Blues boss took the unusual step of naming his side a day before the match, with Jole Cole named in midfield.
4	Mourinho said: We have one more session but I think Drogba will play, and Gallas will play.
4	Drogba trained on Monday with no problems and will do the same on Tuesday.
4	Gallas feels he can play and wants to play.
4	We are protecting him still but he will be okay to play. Drogba, Chelseas £24m striker, has missed the last three weeks through injury.
4	Cech, Ferreira, Carvalho, Terry, Gallas, Tiago, Makelele, Lampard, Cole, Drogba, Gudjohnsen.
4	Chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1) John Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal.
4	Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game.
4	Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunezs header made for a tense finale.
4	It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager.
4	Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinhos sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans.
4	There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.
4	Riise could not have connected any better with Morientes cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech.
4	The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week.
4	The Blues attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampards powerfully-struck drive and Drogbas low shot.
4	Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpools well-organised defence.
4	Joe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares.
4	The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back.
4	Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsens header, then to smother William Gallas follow-up.
4	And despite Chelseas possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech.
4	And the Blues increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle.
4	But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferreriras free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level.
4	That prompted Mourinhos reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining.
4	Dudek saved bravely at the Irishmans feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time.
4	Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post.
4	But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnsons long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home.
4	And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsens cross in the 110th minute.
4	There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpools desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.

4	Newcastle 2-1 Bolton Kieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Boltons 10-game unbeaten run.
4	Lee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross.
4	Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos, who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley.
4	But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearers shot was blocked and firing into the top corner.
4	Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game, with plenty of tackles flying in, but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by.
4	Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearers low shot and Dyers close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note.
4	And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on 35 minutes.
4	Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right.
4	He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carrs cross with a downward header into the far corner.
4	Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.
4	They were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from Giannakopoulos.
4	Jay-Jay Okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving Kevin Davies and Gary Speed, the Greek striker found the bottom corner with a first-time strike.
4	The Magpies were opened up again before half-time as Davies set Giannakopoulos in space and Given had to block at his near post.
4	But the home side survived, and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half.
4	Fernando Hierro cynically chopped down Dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through.
4	But the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby, and from the resultant free-kick Laurent Robert curled the ball just wide.
4	Bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the Magpies.
4	Their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute.
4	Alan Shearers snap-shot was charged down and Dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing Jaaskelainen from six yards.
4	- Bolton boss Sam Allardyce I am bitterly disappointed with the result, but I am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance.
4	In the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure, and our goal matched theirs in quality.
4	I thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games, but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half.
4	We allowed them to heap too much pressure on us, and in the end we cracked. - Newcastle boss Graeme Souness We deserved the win.
4	We had a really good second half.
4	Bolton are a difficult side to play.
4	You have to match them physically first but we did that, and then we played some football.
4	We had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that.
4	The scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals. Newcastle: Given, Carr, Boumsong, Bramble, Babayaro, Dyer, Faye, Bowyer, Robert (Jenas 77), Ameobi, Shearer.

4	Middlesbrough 2-2 Charlton A late header by teenager Danny Graham earned Middlesbrough a battling draw with Charlton at the Riverside.
4	Matt Holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off Franck Queudrue.
4	But Middlesbrough peppered the Charlton goal after the break and Chris Riggott stroked home the equaliser.
4	Shaun Bartletts strike put Charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before Graham rushed onto Queudrues pass to head home.
4	The match burst to life from the whistle and Charlton defender Hermann Hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes.
4	Hreidarsson received Danny Murphys free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post.
4	The Iceland international looked such a danger the Boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him.
4	Charltons early pressure paid off when Bartlett received a long ball from Talal El Karkouri in the box and laid it off to Holland who buried his right-footed strike.
4	Szilard Nemeth, recalled in place of Joseph-Desire Job, was twice denied his chance to get Middlesbrough back on level terms by Dean Kiely.
4	The striker played a great one-two with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink only to see Kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keepers arms.
4	Boro had plenty of time on the ball but the Addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with Kiely tipping a Hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time.
4	It was all one-way traffic after the break at the Riverside as Middlesbrough poured forward and Kiely even saved Hreidarssons blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a Charlton own goal.
4	But the Addicks keeper could do nothing about Riggotts equaliser in the 74th minute.
4	The Boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of Gareth Southgates misdirected effort, but despite the Charlton protests his goal stood.
4	The Addicks did not let their heads drop and Bartlett left the Boro defence standing, picking up Hreidarssons cross to easily sink his right-footed strike.
4	But substitute Graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side.
4	The 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser - and his first Premiership goal - with five minutes left on the clock.
4	I felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre.
4	We dominated after the break, the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win.
4	But for (Charlton goalkeeper) Dean Kiely, who made three tremendous saves, we could have scored five or six. To take the lead and then to get penned back, it feels a little bit like a defeat, admitted Kiely.
4	We were winning but Middlesbrough kept knocking on the door.
4	But we stood up and credit to us we didnt capitulate.
4	Well kick on now.
4	Our short-term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year. Nash, Reiziger (Graham 82), Riggott, Southgate, Queudrue, Parlour (Job 86), Doriva, Nemeth (Parnaby 87), Zenden, Downing, Hasselbaink.

4	Dundee Utd 4-1 Aberdeen Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.
4	Alan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later.
4	Richie Byrnes header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored Uniteds lead from 18 yards before half time.
4	The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1.
4	Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock.
4	Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper.
4	Moments later though, the home side took the lead.
4	Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley.
4	Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelans clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net.
4	United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilsons cross off the angle of post and bar.
4	But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match.
4	A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.
4	United restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half.
4	Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards.
4	United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval.
4	Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson.
4	The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robsons drive after 62 minutes.
4	The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.
4	Robson saw another long-range effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line.

4	8,661 K Clark Clyde 0-5 Celtic Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.
4	The home sides Craig Bryson had a goal chopped off before Stan Varga headed Celtic into the lead.
4	Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled.
4	Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive.
4	Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho.
4	Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov.
4	From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him.
4	Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamys effort to lift the ball over him.
4	The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal.
4	The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net.
4	Maloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break.
4	The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty.
4	Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee.
4	Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar.
4	But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards.
4	Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out.
4	Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net.
4	Halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a McGeady shot wide as the game petered out.

4	Lee Miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over Colin Meldrum and into the net from a Jamie McAllister free kick.
4	McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors.
4	Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on.
4	The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal.
4	McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum.
4	With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead.
4	Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum.
4	Moments later Miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.
4	Then McAllister picked up a pass from Stephen Simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past Meldrums far post.
4	The impressive Mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by Meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keepers right-hand post.
4	Livi manager Richard Gough made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender Goran Stanic, midfielder Gabor Vincze, and striker Ferenc Horvath for Bahoken, Derek Lilley and Mark Wilson.
4	But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed.
4	However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal.
4	Eric Deloumeaux sent Jason Dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to McPake, who looked to be in an offside position.
4	The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and Dair ran on to it and played Easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range.
4	The home side called for offside against McPake but referee Alan Freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle.
4	Livi went all out for the equaliser.
4	In the 87th minute, Burton OBrien was hauled back at the edge of the box by Neil MacFarlane, but Dair sent his shot just inches wide.
4	Gordon, Webster, Miller, Hartley, Neilson, McAllister, Simmons (MacFarlane 64), Berra, Burchill (Wyness 82), Mikoliunas (Cesnauskis 77), Wallace.
4	Moilanen, Kizys.
4	Berra, Webster.

4	9,796 A Freeland Kenyon denies Robben Barca return Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.
4	Hes been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but well have to wait and see, he told BBC Five Lives Sportsweek.
4	Were looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but hell be back when its right for him and for us.
4	Theres no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game. His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February.
4	Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March.
4	I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen, Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday.
4	I put everything right with Arjens foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.
4	It was an obvious correction and easy to perform.
4	I know he was pleased with what I did and now that he is running again.
4	I am due to see him one more time again in the next few days. Meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at Italian side AC Milan.
4	Bridge could miss rest of season Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.
4	The England international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday.
4	We think its a big injury, said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final.
4	William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game.
4	France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelseas 1-0 defeat at St James Park.
4	With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicinis red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players.
4	Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension.
4	The manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he has few options to replace Bridge at left-back.
4	Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself.
4	It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right.
4	Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie.
4	Bridges injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.
4	He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season, he said.
4	The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff.
4	We will have to wait and see, but I wont cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday. Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridges injury.
4	I dont know what happened. he said.
4	It was just a shame.
4	I dont think we even touched each other.
4	By all accounts its pretty serious.
4	I went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best. Mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger Arjen Robben to a serious injury.
4	Parry firm over Gerrard Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.
4	But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future.
4	He told BBC Five Live: Steven is above money.
4	He is the future of Liverpool.
4	It doesnt matter if its £30m, £40m or £50m, we will not accept offers.
4	But we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep Steven against his will. On the subject of Liverpools finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.
4	And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.
4	Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League.
4	There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.
4	On the subject of Liverpools captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid did ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes.
4	He said: They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale. But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: I sincerely hope he will be.
4	Steven knows my views.
4	He knows Rafas views.
4	We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him.
4	We crave success as much as he does.
4	We know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that.
4	I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than hed like to do anything else.
4	We all want to see progress by next season.
4	Hes not alone in that.
4	There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim. It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.
4	There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths.
4	It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer.
4	We didnt had an offer last summer, Parry explained.
4	We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him.
4	In reality it didnt go beyond that.
4	Maybe there will be an offer in the summer.
4	Maybe there wont.
4	Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.
4	You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will.
4	That just doesnt work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda.
4	You can forget that. Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpools new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007.
4	And he confessed Arsenals £100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought.
4	He said: I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.
4	I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating.
4	But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow - thats interesting.
4	 My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium. Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.
4	If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell.
4	I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to.
4	Thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore. On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East.
4	That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board.
4	He also accused Liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids, but Parry explained: Steve has never been used as a stalking horse.
4	Theres no need, and that is not the way we do business.
4	We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004.
4	I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen.
4	Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it.
4	We are still evaluating it.
4	Steves interest was taken very much on its own merits.
4	His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? The door isnt closed on anything.
4	We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year.
4	We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful.
4	Thats a dream we all share, so as far as Im concerned the door is not closed. I would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.
4	As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really? £50m for Gerrard? I dont care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.
4	We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrards quality.
4	Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.
4	Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.
4	Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.
4	I am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.
4	£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.
4	I would however be happy with Gerrards transfer for any fee over £35m.
4	Parrys statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.
4	Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.
4	I would keep Gerrard.
4	No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.
4	The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy.
4	Clearly, if he isnt, then we would be foolish not to sell.
4	The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.
4	Wright-Phillips to start on right England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has revealed Shaun Wright-Phillips will start against the Netherlands.
4	But Wright-Phillips will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected.
4	Shaun Wright-Phillips will probably start the game, said Eriksson.
4	But Im not going to start Wright-Phillips on the left. Eriksson also revealed that Wes Brown will start alongside Jamie Carragher in the injury-hit centre of defence.
4	When asked if Brown and Carragher would start Eriksson replied: I could tell you yes.
4	Its a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries.
4	On the other hand its good for Carragher and Brown to show what they can do at this level.
4	Thats positive. The England coach said that he had been impressed by Wright-Phillips form for Manchester City.
4	He deserves his chance.
4	He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him. And he added that Andy Johnson and Stewart Downing - the other two new players in the squad - would also get a chance to impress.
4	Wright-Phillips, Downing and Johnson will start or get the chance to play some part.
4	Johnson was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals.
4	Downing is another one making a great season.
4	He is young, talented and there are not too many left-footed players in the squad. Robben sidelined with broken foot Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.
4	Robben had an MRI scan on the injury, sustained during the Premiership win at Blackburn, on Monday.
4	Six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then I need a few more weeks to be completely fit again, he told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.
4	I had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis. The 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with Romas Olivier Dacourt.
4	And he added: It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot.
4	Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period.
4	I hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks. Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March.
4	The fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month, Banks told the clubs website.
4	One is a chip on the side of his foot, the other is a small break on the third metatarsal.
4	But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months. David Beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan.
4	Robben, who has been a key part of the Blues push for four trophies, claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder Aaron Mokoena.
4	I felt my leg go, he said.
4	I felt it straight away after Mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot. Giggs handed Wales leading role Ryan Giggs will captain Wales as he wins his 50th cap in Wednesdays friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.
4	John Toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding Mark Hughes, admits he is surprised that Giggs has only just reached the landmark.
4	With the games hes played for United, proportionately it doesnt seem that many for Wales, Toshack said.
4	But hes one of the greatest of all Welsh internationals and on his 50th cap its appropriate hes captain. Giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for Wales in the 2008 European Championships.
4	The Manchester United wing revealed how club manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked him into extending his Wales career.
4	I briefly discussed my international future with Sir Alex, but he urged me to carry on, Giggs said.
4	He feels, like myself, that I have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years time I will be able to play in the European finals if we get there.
4	The manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because I am fit enough. Giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former Wales skipper Gary Speed and United team-mate Paul Scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football.
4	But Giggs is now focussed on making the Toshack era even more successful than the time Hughes spent at the helm.
4	The Manchester United winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991, an away loss to Germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31.
4	With Giggs leading Wales out against Hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to Speed.
4	However, Toshack refused to reveal whether he sees Giggs as a long-term option.
4	For this particular game I think it is appropriate that Ryan Giggs will be captain, its his 50th cap and hes known for some time about that, Toshack said.
4	On Wednesday night Toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing Hughes, and Giggs said: Its my 50th cap and I am looking forward to it, and I hope to play a lot more times from here on in.
4	Its important to be here, all the players feel the same.
4	Its a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important.
4	I see myself leading by example, it is something I have taken on for Wales as well as United these past few seasons.
4	The way John is looking at things, he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament, the Euro 2006 event.
4	I have told John I will be around for the next European tournament, by then I will be 35 so hopefully I will still be okay.
4	A lot can happen, but Im hoping to be around. Giggs own personal future at Old Trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract, with Manchester United offering one extra year and Giggs seeking two.
4	I have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment, said Giggs.
4	It is an important period for the club and I am just concentrated on that.
4	Ive heard the suggestions, hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what I am looking for, to get it sorted out.
4	Im enjoying my football, the way United have been playing and my own form, you have to enjoy it.
4	We have massive games coming up: Manchester City this week, then the Everton cup tie, followed by AC Milan in the Champions League, and my first Wales game under John Toshack, so its an important time. Bosvelt optimistic over new deal Manchester Citys Paul Bosvelt will find out within a month whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal.
4	The 34-year-old Dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and, although his age may count against him, he feels he can play on for another season.
4	I told the club I would like to stay for one more year.
4	They promised me an answer within the next month so I am waiting to see, he said.
4	The main concern is my age but I think I have proved I am fit enough.
4	Bosvelt joined City from Feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in England.
4	But his professionalism and dedication impressed manager Kevin Keegan.
4	He realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team.
4	He is an unsung hero, said Keegan.
4	Sociedad set to rescue Mladenovic Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder Dragan Mladenovic to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window.
4	Sociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis.
4	Mladenovic will effectively replace former Rangers midfielder Mikel Arteta, who has been loaned to Everton.
4	Sociedad say they will pay Rangers £150,000, with an option to buy the Serbia & Montenegro international.
4	Mladenovics loan move is subject to him passing a medical.
4	The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for £1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national sides game against Bulgaria.
4	Sociedad are in 15th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, just two points above the relegation zone.
4	Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender Igor Jauregi.
4	The versatile Mladenovic can also play in the back four.
4	His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club.
4	Mladenovics time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.
4	Parry relishes Anfield challenge BBC Sport reflects on the future for Liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive Rick Parry.
4	Chief executive Parry is the man at the helm as Liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history.
4	Parry has to deliver a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above £120m.
4	He is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore Liverpool to their place at European footballs top table.
4	But it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with Parry, who has forged a reputation as one of footballs most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling Premier League.
4	Liverpool have not won the championship since 1990, a fact that causes deep discomfort inside Anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal.
4	Throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain Steven Gerrard, and you can see Parry is a man with a lot on his plate.
4	But in the comfort of a conference room deep inside Liverpools heartbeat - The Kop end - Parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead.
4	He only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting Liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry.
4	But to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that Liverpool still mean business.
4	By business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to Liverpool is Parrys mission.
4	Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez.
4	And his enthusiasm for the Spaniards personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold.
4	Benitezs early work has given Parry renewed optimism about the years ahead.
4	But it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations.
4	This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting... Captain Gerrard is central to Liverpools plans and Parrys insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent.
4	As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish.
4	In terms of the search for new investment, Hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in March 2004.
4	Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.
4	Morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium.
4	BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.
4	Morgan, however, has had no formal contact with Liverpool or their advisors since last December, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his £70m offer.
4	He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool.
4	Morgan will certainly not be making another call.
4	So speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the Middle East and America, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from Anfield.
4	Parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to Liverpools future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea.
4	He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium.
4	Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re-shaped Liverpools thinking.
4	Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenals stunning £100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape.
4	Parry labelled the deal an eye-opener and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities.
4	He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just Anfield, but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.
4	I would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.
4	As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really? £50m for Gerrard? I dont care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.
4	We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrards quality.
4	Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.
4	Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.
4	Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.
4	I am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.
4	£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.
4	I would however be happy with Gerrards transfer for any fee over £35m.
4	Parrys statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.
4	Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.
4	I would keep Gerrard.
4	No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.
4	The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy.
4	Clearly, if he isnt, then we would be foolish not to sell.
4	The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.
4	Time to get tough on friendlies? For an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.
4	The only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce.
4	Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.
4	I would say its 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so.
4	It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured.
4	But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing.
4	The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil.
4	Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half.
4	And its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole teams worth.
4	The debate will rage on, and Im not sure there is a satisfactory solution.
4	One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith.
4	The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts.
4	It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter, who is a canny manager.
4	The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers.
4	If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever.
4	John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary.
4	He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results.
4	Its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies.
4	If you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you.
4	Englands game against Holland is a good example.
4	It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson.
4	But you have got to remember Sven-Goran Erikssons side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played.
4	The injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher a chance to impress.
4	For the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.
4	Barcelona title hopes hit by loss Barcelonas pursuit of the Spanish title took a blow on Sunday as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at home to Atletico Madrid.
4	Fernando Torres gave Athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute.
4	Ronaldino wasted a second-half chance to equalise for Barca when he put a penalty wide, but Torres made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick.
4	The defeat, coupled with Real Madrids 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday, reduces Barcas lead to four points.
4	Former Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen scored his first goal for Real in the comfortable victory at the Bernabeu.
4	Zinedine Zidane had opened the scoring before Raul bagged a brace.
4	Gravesen, who replaced Zidane, completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot.
4	David Beckham, watched by Sven-Goran Eriksson, came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for Englands game against Holland.
4	England team-mate Michael Owen came on for Raul after 76 minutes with the game already won.
4	Real have now won six consecutive Primera Liga games since coach Wanderley Luxemburgo took charge.
4	Parry puts Gerrard above money Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.
4	But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future.
4	He told BBC Five Live: Steven is above money.
4	He is the future of Liverpool.
4	It doesnt matter if its £30m, £40m or £50m, we will not accept offers.
4	But we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep Steven against his will. On the subject of Liverpools finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.
4	And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.
4	Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League.
4	There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.
4	On the subject of Liverpools captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid did ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes.
4	He said: They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale. But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: I sincerely hope he will be.
4	Steven knows my views.
4	He knows Rafas views.
4	We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him.
4	We crave success as much as he does.
4	We know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that.
4	I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than hed like to do anything else.
4	We all want to see progress by next season.
4	Hes not alone in that.
4	There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim. It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.
4	There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths.
4	It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer.
4	We didnt had an offer last summer, Parry explained.
4	We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him.
4	In reality it didnt go beyond that.
4	Maybe there will be an offer in the summer.
4	Maybe there wont.
4	Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.
4	You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will.
4	That just doesnt work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda.
4	You can forget that. Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpools new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007.
4	And he confessed Arsenals £100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought.
4	He said: I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.
4	I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating.
4	But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow - thats interesting.
4	 My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium. Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.
4	If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell.
4	I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to.
4	Thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore. On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East.
4	That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board.
4	He also accused Liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids, but Parry explained: Steve has never been used as a stalking horse.
4	Theres no need, and that is not the way we do business.
4	We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004.
4	I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen.
4	Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it.
4	We are still evaluating it.
4	Steves interest was taken very much on its own merits.
4	His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? The door isnt closed on anything.
4	We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year.
4	We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful.
4	Thats a dream we all share, so as far as Im concerned the door is not closed. I would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.
4	As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really? £50m for Gerrard? I dont care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.
4	We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrards quality.
4	Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.
4	Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.
4	Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.
4	I am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.
4	£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.
4	I would however be happy with Gerrards transfer for any fee over £35m.
4	Parrys statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.
4	Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.
4	I would keep Gerrard.
4	No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.
4	The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy.
4	Clearly, if he isnt, then we would be foolish not to sell.
4	The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.
4	Bees handed potential Man Utd tie Brentford face a home tie against holders Manchester United in the FA Cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against Southampton.
4	The League One side held the Saints at St Marys in their fifth-round tie and were rewarded with a potential draw against Sir Alex Fergusons side.
4	Newcastle will be at home to either Tottenham or Nottingham Forest.
4	Bolton host Arsenal or Sheffield United and Leicester will visit the winners of the Burnley and Blackburn replay.
4	The ties will be played on the weekend of 12-13 March.
4	was delighted to be paired with United, although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up a dream tie.
4	Weve got our work cut out next Tuesday but you cant deny its exciting, he said.
4	It would be a sell-out.
4	It will probably be on television.
4	We have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation.
4	Were happy to be in the draw but weve still got to beat a Premiership team.
4	Weve got to beat Southampton first and thats going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration. welcomed the opportunity to face United.
4	Were not counting on anything yet, he said.
4	It is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way Brentford came back at us on Saturday and the fact that United have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive.
4	But Ive been drawn against United so many times in cups and beaten them at both Bournemouth and West Ham.
4	There are no easy ties in the FA Cup and Im sure nobody is counting on one. Newcastle v Tottenham or Nottingham Forest Southampton or Brentford v Manchester United Bolton v Arsenal or Sheffield United Burnley or Blackburn v Leicester Englands defensive crisis grows Englands defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenhams Ledley King from the squad to face Holland.
4	Chelseas John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leaving coach Sven-Goran Eriksson with a real problem for Wednesdays match at Villa Park.
4	Injured Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell were both left out of the squad, and Matthew Upson has already pulled out.
4	Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership.
4	Terry, the captain of Chelsea as they push for the Premiership title, would have been a certain starter in the absence of Campbell and Ferdinand.
4	But now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by Carragher, alongside Brown.
4	Manchester Uniteds Brown last played for England in the defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003.
4	The 25-year-old was only called into the squad on Sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of Upson, who has a hamstring injury.
4	And Brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for England.
4	King was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by Englands medical staff.
4	Eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up, having already summoned Phil Neville after Bridge pulled out with a foot injury.
4	Ferdinand casts doubt over Glazer Rio Ferdinand has said he is unsure of Malcolm Glazers motives after the American billionaire launched a new offer to buy Manchester United.
4	The club have confirmed that the Glazer Family Partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid.
4	A lot of people want the clubs interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart, said Ferdinand.
4	No one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table. The central defender added on BBC Radio Five Live: We will have to wait and see what Glazer comes with.
4	I would like to see the situation resolved either way.
4	I think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals.
4	The other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch. Glazer, currently owns a 28.1% stake in the club, and Uniteds statement to the stock exchange said: The board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject.
4	The board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for Manchester United from Glazer.
4	A further announcement will be made in due course. Glazers previous bids for the club, which United supporters opposed, were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur.
4	But it is believed that Glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move.
4	He will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club to succeed.
4	But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake, while fans remain opposed to his involvement.
4	Premier League planning Cole date The Premier League is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations Chelsea made an illegal approach for Ashley Cole.
4	Both Chelsea and Arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a Premier League commission, but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene.
4	Its hard to put a date on it, a Premier League spokesman confirmed to BBC Sport.
4	Its not a formal situation where theyve got so much time to respond. Arsenal and England defender Cole reportedly met Blues boss Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon in a London hotel 11 days ago.
4	Chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting, which would be in breach of Premier League rule K3.
4	Now the Gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been tapped up.
4	Both clubs have pledged to co-operate with the inquiry which will be conducted on a single day as opposed to being run as an ongoing evaluation.
4	Cole is in negotiations with the Gunners over extending his current deal which ends in 2007.
4	And his Arsenal team-mate Robert Pires has urged the England left-back to stay at Highbury.
4	Pires told the Evening Standard: He has been at Arsenal for ever.
4	He is a very attacking left-back and I think he is enjoying his football because at Arsenal he plays in an offensive team.
4	I am not sure he will get the same pleasure at Chelsea, even though they are doing so well at the moment.
4	I have built a fantastic playing relationship with Ashley.
4	We play together so well - we could do it with our eyes shut.
4	But you have to respect the decision of the player.
4	Everybody has that right. McCall earns Tannadice reprieve Dundee United manager Ian McCall has won a reprieve from the sack, with chairman Eddie Thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future.
4	It is understood that McCall would have been sacked if Sheffield Wednesday manager Paul Sturrock had been willing to return to Tannadice.
4	But Sturrock has distanced himself from the position.
4	Were in a difficult situation.
4	We must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel, said Thompson.
4	Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup, he added.
4	However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up.
4	The minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only.
4	Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final, subject to the draw.
4	All that matters at the present time - is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved. Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their sides 3-0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South.
4	We want the boss to stay, we dont want someone else coming in, said Jim McIntyre.
4	Hopefully now he gets the chance to stay. Keeper Tony Bullock echoed McIntyres sentiments.
4	I think all the boys are behind Ian McCall, he added.
4	At the moment it is all speculation and we have got to rise above all that and do a job on the pitch. On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One.
4	Ive only been here five months and I dont expect to be leaving very, very soon, he said.
4	I can appreciate the rumours because Ive emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United.
4	I can assure you the timescale is not the right one.
4	It (Dundee United) is my team.
4	I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once youve done that kind of thing, its the result you look for.
4	The important thing now is Ive come here to do a job and Im going to try to finish it. Kewell waits as injury drags on Liverpool winger Harry Kewell is struggling to recover from his Achilles tendinitis problem and may not recover until March, claims his agent.
4	Kewell, 26, had hoped to play against Fulham last weekend and to be ready for the Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen on 22 February.
4	But Bernie Mandic said: Hes had scans which dont show anything substantial.
4	But despite his best efforts at the moment he simply cant shake off the discomfort and get back on the park. Mandic continued in the Sydney Morning Herald: Harrys struggling a bit but the club are doing everything they can to get him right.
4	Harry was desperate to be fit for the Fulham game as part of his plan to play himself in for the Leverkusen match. Kewell has not played since December 19 and misses out on international duty this week, with Australia facing South Africa in Durban on Wednesday.
4	Smith aims to bring back respect Scotland manager Walter Smith says he wants to restore the national teams respectability in world football.
4	Smith has joined his first squad for a three-day get-together near Manchester in preference to playing a friendly.
4	While qualification for the 2006 World Cup appears to be beyond Scotland, Smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive.
4	I think we have got to try to get a bit of respectability back in whatever way we can, he said.
4	We will have to approach each game differently.
4	Obviously we will have to approach the Italian game away from home in a different manner to Moldova at home.
4	We have to meet the challenge of each match. Smith, meeting a number of his squad for the first time, brought them together on Monday to outline his ideas for improving the nations fortunes.
4	He said: I pointed out how I see the international team going forward and that was the main topic.
4	This is a relaxed gathering and I dont think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists. A 25-man squad will spend the next three days based at the Mottram Hall hotel in Cheshire and will train at Manchester Uniteds nearby Carrington complex.
4	Smith will be absent for the final sessions, however, as he is due to fly out to Sardinia on Wednesday to watch Italys friendly with Russia.
4	Injury doubts beset Wales squad Wales have a clutch of injury worries before Wednesdays international friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.
4	West Hams Gavin Williams (ankle) looks certain to be out, so uncapped Wrexham defender Stephen Roberts is drafted in.
4	Defenders Danny Gabbidon and Gareth Roberts, plus Ryan Giggs have hamstring concerns, while there are also doubts over Robbie Savage (groin).
4	However, Manchester United winger Giggs is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the Millennium Stadium.
4	There were also doubts over Gabbidons fellow Cardiff defender Rhys Weston, but the full-back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the Bluebirds 1-0 loss to West Ham on Sunday.
4	The news leaves Wales boss John Toshack short in defence for his first game in charge, with Aston Villas Mark Delaney injured and James Collins with the Under-21s.
4	That could clear the way for new faces Danny Collins and Dave Partridge to make their Wales debuts.
4	Coyne (Burnley), Jones (Wolves), Roberts (Wrexham), Collins (Sunderland), Edwards (Wolves), Gabbidon (Cardiff), Page (Cardiff), Partridge (Motherwell), Ricketts (Swansea), Roberts (Tranmere), Weston (Cardiff), Davies (Tottenham), Fletcher (West Ham), Giggs (Man Utd), Koumas (West Brom), Robinson (Sunderland), Savage (Blackburn), Williams (West Ham), Bellamy (Newcastle), Earnshaw (West Brom), Hartson (Celtic).
4	Weir poised for Sunderland move Larnes teenage star Robbie Weir is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City.
4	The 17-year-old Irish League midfielder was also being chased by Rangers and Fulham, but Mick McCarthys side appear to have won the race.
4	But Larne boss Jimmy McGeough has yet to confirm that Weir is on his way from Inver Park.
4	I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself, he said.
4	Robbie has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs.
4	Personally, I would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full-time game.
4	He has been on trial with a number of clubs.
4	But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.
4	 Newry to fight cup exit in courts Newry City are expected to discuss legal avenues on Friday regarding overturning their ejection from the Nationwide Irish Cup.
4	The IFA upheld its original decision to throw Newry out of the cup following the Andy Crawford registration row.
4	A law firm will put a case forward for Newry FC, and see what the legal implications of all this is are, said Newry boss Roy McCreadie.
4	This is a big issue, now that we have an appeal pending, On Wednesday, a fresh IFA hearing into Crawford registration saga, ruled that last weeks original verdict had been correct.
4	It meant that Bangor, beaten 5-1 by Newry on the field, will take on Portadown in the sixth round.
4	Newry had claimed they had uncovered fresh evidence, in respect of the dates relating to the registration.
4	But McCreadie is not further annoyed that full details of Wednesdays meeting was not relayed to the club.
4	Even to this day, we have as much information about what happened during the meeting on Wednesday as that told to the media.
4	We are being kept in the dark, McCreadie told the News Letter .
4	We want an explanation.
4	There is no good sending us the same fax message the press people received.
4	Its a real sad case.
4	If we are not back in the Irish Cup after our appeal, and guided by our legal advise, we will seek to lodge an injunction in the courts to stop Bangor playing Portadown.
4	 Republic to face China and Italy The Republic of Ireland have arranged friendlies against China and Italy which will take place at Lansdowne Road in March and August.
4	Brian Kerrs side will face the 54th ranked Chinese on 29 March - just three days after the World Cup qualifier against Israel in Tel Aviv.
4	Italy will visit on 17 August in what will be a warm-up game ahead of the autumn World Cup qualifiers.
4	In their last meeting, the Irish beat Italy in the 1994 World Cup Finals.
4	However, that is the Republics only victory in eight attempts against the Italians who have won all the other seven games.
4	The 29 March game will be the second time the Republic have played China - the previous encounter back in June 1984 with the Irish winning 1-0 in Sapporo, Japan.
4	Brian Kerr said: China have made great progress over the last few years and will provide difficult opposition.
4	We all witnessed the performances of the Asian teams in the last World Cup, and China play a similar type of football.
4	As for Italy, they make a welcome return to Dublin and will be a massive attraction because they are one of the great traditional powers in the world.
4	The game will be ideal preparation for the three important World Cup qualifiers in the autumn. Ireland round off their World Cup campaign with games against France on 7 September, Cyprus on 8 October and Switzerland on 12 October.
4	Finnan says Irish can win group Steve Finnan believes the Republic of Ireland can qualify directly for the World Cup finals.
4	After Saturdays superb display in the draw in Paris, Ireland face minnows the Faroe Islands in Dublin on Wednesday.
4	The versatile Finnan, who starred against the French, is confident the group is Irelands for the taking.
4	There is a chance for us now to go on, win our home games and why not win the group, even though its a tough one, said the Liverpool player.
4	Switzerland, Ireland, France and Israel are all now tied on five points from three matches - although the Republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in Basel and Paris.
4	In Basel we did not play great football, but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game.
4	In Paris, we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances.
4	Looking back, we had an opportunity to get the three points, but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into Wednesdays game.
4	On paper, we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves.
4	Automatic qualification is there.
4	It would certainly be good to avoid a play-off, but on the back of a couple of good results I dont see why we cant win the group. Manager Brian Kerr was keen to mention the contribution of Stephen Carr and Finnan on Irelands right flank at the Stade de France.
4	Finnans normal position is right-back but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the French.
4	As I play on the right for my club and being a natural right-back, it was something he (Kerr) looked at because France play strongly down the left-hand side.
4	So I was happy to play and Stephen Carr and I enjoyed the game, particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks. Irish finish with home game Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr has been granted his wish for a home game as the final World Cup qualifier.
4	Ireland will close their bid to reach the 2006 finals by playing Switzerland in Dublin on 12 October 2005.
4	The Republic met the Swiss in their final Euro 2004 qualifier, losing 2-0 away and missing out on a place in the finals in Portugal.
4	The Group Four fixtures were hammered out at a meeting in Dublin on Tuesday.
4	The Irish open their campaign on 4 September at home to Cyprus and wrap up the 10-match series on 12 October 2005, with the visit of Switzerland.
4	Manager Brian Kerr and FAI officials met representatives from Switzerland, France, Cyprus, Israel and the Faroe Islands to arrange the fixture schedule.
4	Kerr had hoped to finish with a clash against France, but got the reigning European champions as their penultimate home match on 7 September 2005.
4	The manager got his wish to avoid a repeat of finishing their bid to qualify with too many away matches.

4	Israeli club look to Africa Four African players, including Zimbabwe goalkeeper Energy Murambadoro, are all ready to play for Israeli club Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin in the Uefa Cup.
4	Bnei Sakhnin are the first Arab side ever to play in European competition and will play English Premiership side Newcastle United in the first round.
4	Warriors goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albanias Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round.
4	Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic.
4	The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.
4	The club have a strong ethic and are high profile promoters of peace and co-operation within Israel.
4	The three other Africans at the club are former Cameroon defender Ernest Etchi, DR Congos Alain Masudi and Nigerian midfielder Edith Agoye, who had a stint with Tunisian side Esperance.
4	Iranian misses Israel match Iranian striker Vahid Hashemian will not travel to Israel for Bayern Munichs Champions League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday.
4	The German club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury.
4	Iran refuses to recognise Israels right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country.
4	A Bayern spokesman said on Monday that the decision not to take Hashemian to Israel had been motivated only by his physical condition.
4	Hes got back pain and he couldnt train, the spokesman said.
4	It would have made no sense for him to go. Iran gave judo world champion Arash Miresmaeili a $125,000 reward when he refused to fight an Israeli at the Athens Olympics.
4	The International Judo Federation considered taking action against Miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.
4	Highbury tunnel players in clear The Football Association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the Arsenal and Manchester United game.
4	Arsenals Patrick Vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened Gary Neville before the 4-2 defeat.
4	Vieira also clashed with opposing skipper Roy Keane and referee Graham Poll had to separate them.
4	The referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time, said an FA statement.
4	It means Uniteds win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body, whose new chief executive Brian Barwick was in the Highbury stands.
4	I didnt threaten anybody.
4	They are big enough players to handle themselves, said Vieira.
4	I had a talk with Roy Keane and thats it.
4	Gary Neville is a big lad, he can handle himself.
4	They just played better than us and deserved to win. Neville admitted there had been incidents before the game, but insisted it had not distracted his focus.
4	There were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you, he said.
4	Especially from players of that calibre, but its a tough game and weve been around a long time. Neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match, which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of Mikael Silvestre for head-butting Freddie Ljungberg .
4	I thought it was a horrible game in the first half, and it was not much better in the second, he said.
4	There is no way that should have happened in a football match. After the match, Keane accused Vieira of starting the row.
4	Patrick Vieira is 6ft 4in and having a go at Gary Neville.
4	So I said, have a go at me, he said.
4	If he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that Gary Neville is an easy target, Im not having it. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added: Vieira was well wound up for it.
4	Ive heard different stories.
4	Patrick Vieira has apparently threatened some of our players and things like that. Bellamy under new fire Newcastle boss Graeme Souness has reopened his dispute with Craig Bellamy after claiming the Welshman was not good enough for the Magpies.
4	Bellamy left Newcastle to join Celtic on loan after a major row with Souness.
4	Souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said Bellamy did not score enough goals The chap thats just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those werent even in the top flight, said Souness.
4	Thats not good enough for a striker at a club like this.
4	We need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis. Bellamy turned down a move to Birmingham in favour of joining Celtic after a disagreement about the Welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated.
4	Earlier in the week, Souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after Bellamy accused him of lying.
4	There are certain things you can forgive and forget, said Souness.
4	But if Id been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job I have after Newcastle. He could then return to St James Park - and he says that he wants to.
4	However, it would seem unlikely he will play for Newcastle again as long as Souness remains in charge.
4	Chelsea denied by James heroics A brave defensive display, led by keeper David James, helped Manchester City hold the leaders Chelsea.
4	After a quiet opening, James denied Damien Duff, Jiri Jarosik and Mateja Kezman, while Paul Bosvelt cleared William Gallas header off the line.
4	Robbie Fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide.
4	Chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but James kept out Frank Lampards free-kick and superbly tipped the same players volley wide.
4	City went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat Chelsea this season.
4	And there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as Chelsea - deprived of Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat.
4	Indeed, it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace.
4	Shaun Wright-Phillips - watched by England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by John Terry.
4	But Chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances.
4	First, Duff got round Ben Thatcher and blasted in a shot that James parried to Kezman, who turned the ball wide.
4	Soon afterwards, Jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head Lampards corner goalwards but James tipped the ball over.
4	Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leaders and James kept out Kezmans fierce drive before Bosvelt and James combined to clear Gallas header from Duffs corner.
4	City broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in Fowler celebrating his 150th Premiership goal.
4	Wright-Phillips raced down the left and crossed to Fowler but Citys lone man up front, left free by Terrys slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain.
4	The second half started as quietly as the first, although James was forced to divert a cross from the lively Duff away from Eidur Gudjohnsens path.
4	There was a nasty moment for Petr Cech, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochets saw Fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the Czech Republic stopper.
4	Another quiet spell followed, which Duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by Bosvelt.
4	Lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and James somehow blocked it with his legs.
4	Another timely challenge, this time from Richard Dunne in time added on, prevented Gudjohnsen from getting in a shot.
4	There was still time for James to produce a sensational save to tip Lampards volley round the post.
4	Cech, Paulo Ferreira, Gallas, Terry, Bridge, Jarosik (Tiago 56), Lampard, Makelele, Duff, Gudjohnsen, Kezman (Cole 63).

4	Chelsea ridiculed over complaint Barcelona assistant coach Henk Ten Cate has branded Chelseas expected complaint to Uefa as pathetic.
4	The Blues are poised to complain about an alleged half-time incident during Wednesdays 2-1 loss at the Nou Camp.
4	The source of Chelseas anger was an alleged talk between Barca boss Frank Rijkaard and referee Anders Frisk, who later dismissed Didier Drogba.
4	To react the way Chelsea have is pathetic.
4	Mourinho lied with the line-ups, and now this, Ten Cate said.
4	Uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the half-time break.
4	Spokesman William Gaillard said: Frisk says Rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game.
4	We had two Uefa officials there and neither witnessed it.
4	The referees dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in. Indeed, it is the Londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat.
4	Uefa delegate Thomas Giordano added: The only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that Chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference. The referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to Uefa - weakening Chelseas case.
4	Rijkaard was critical of Mourinhos decision not to speak to the media after the match.
4	There was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game.
4	It is not good behaviour after a match, he said.
4	Maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is.
4	I really dont understand it.
4	I am very calm about it. Barca midfielder Deco, formerly managed by Mourinho at Porto, agreed that it was not typical of his fellow Portuguese to lodge a protest.
4	Its not normal behaviour on his part.
4	It was not logical he did not give a news conference, he said.
4	Rijkaard added: Chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the English league and they defend very well so I am very pleased with the win.
4	My men deserved victory and I am pleased to have won this match.
4	I congratulate my players. Benitez issues warning to Gerrard Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has ordered captain Steven Gerrard not to play down their Champions League ambitions and be more positive.
4	Gerrard told the BBC Liverpool were unlikely to win the trophy this year.
4	Benitez responded: I spoke to Steven and said to him that in future its better to think we can win the Champions League.
4	Why not? He said: We need winners here and everyone thinking only of winning.
4	I always want to win. Benitez added: When we lose I only think of solutions.
4	If you only think about winning the next game, you dont know what the draw will be.
4	If we can win the next game, maybe we will draw a side that isnt so strong, or a side with injuries or suspensions. Benitez is hoping to win his first trophy since arriving at Liverpool from Valencia when they play Chelsea in the Carling Cup on Sunday in Cardiff.
4	Owen determined to stay in Madrid England forward Michael Owen has told the BBC he is happy in Spain and has no plans to quit Real Madrid to return to the Premiership in the near future.
4	But the 25-year-old, who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in La Liga, did not rule out a return to the Premiership at some stage.
4	Im pleased with the start Ive made here, he told BBC Radio Five Live.
4	England is my country.
4	Its definitely part of me but who knows whether, if or when Ill be playing there again. Owen, who moved to the Bernabeu from Liverpool last summer, has grabbed 11 goals for Real but has been unable to replace Raul or Ronaldo in the starting line-up.
4	However, he said he was delighted with the way his time in Spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join Real.
4	When I first came there was a lot of scepticism back in England, any maybe some out here, he said.
4	People were saying fourth-choice striker, what are you going there for? Youll be sat on the bench all the time.
4	But as much as our press like to build it up as if Ive permanently had my backside on the bench, Ive played as many games as anyone else in the team this year.
4	For a fourth-choice striker at the start Im more than happy with the way Ive settled in. Recent speculation has linked Owen with a move back to England, with Newcastle expressing their interest, but the England striker said he is not ready to return home.
4	He added: Ive got nothing against the Premiership, I mean thats where I first performed, thats where I made my name.
4	I cant keep my eyes off the Premiership on television when Im at home. When asked if it would have to be Liverpool if he returned Owen said: Ive not really given it much thought.
4	Ive got great memories of Liverpool.
4	No matter what happens itll always be a club I have fond memories of and it will always have a place in my heart.
4	Its very flattering to be linked to top clubs in England - Im glad that no-one is forgetting me! But I couldnt have wished for a better start in Madrid. - Listen to the full interview with Garry Richardson on BBC Radio Five Lives Sportsweek at 0900 GMT on Sunday.
4	Wenger handed summer war chest Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer.
4	The clubs managing director, Keith Edelman, stressed that the development of their new £350m stadium had no affect on Wengers spending power.
4	The money is there.
4	Dont worry weve got it, Edelman told BBC Sport.
4	Hopefully, well spend it this summer and in the coming years.
4	Arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong. Edelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings.
4	Its great to have nice, new surroundings, but if the team arent performing on the pitch, then there isnt great respect in having a fabulous stadium, he said.
4	Its important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place, before we began on the stadium. Souness delight at Euro progress Boss Graeme Souness felt Newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the Uefa Cup against Heerenveen.
4	An early own goal followed by an Alan Shearer strike earned them a 2-1 win and a place in the Uefa Cup last 16.
4	Obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage, he said after the 4-2 aggregate victory.
4	We got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous. Shearers goal moved him within 12 of Jackie Milburns club scoring record of 200 for the Magpies.
4	But Souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season.
4	I think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway, he added.
4	He struck the ball very well - he always has done - and I think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper. Souness also paid tribute to Laurent Robert, who was at the heart of much of Uniteds attacking play.
4	In the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player.
4	More of the same in future please, he said.
4	Downing injury mars Uefa victory Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren hopes that Stewart Downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the 2-1 Uefa Cup win over Graz AK.
4	The winger was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages as Boro booked their place in the last 16.
4	McClaren said: Stewart has tweaked a hamstring, which is a blow for us.
4	We will assess it in the morning.
4	But Im delighted with the match result.
4	They say in sport you can win ugly - and we certainly did. McClaren was relieved to make it through after a tough encounter at The Riverside.
4	To be fair to Graz, they had a gameplan - they knocked the ball forward, especially in the first half, and we struggled to deal with it.
4	In the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal - but one slip and they were back in it. Boro face Sporting Lisbon for a place in the quarter-finals after the Portuguese side saw off Feyenoord on Thursday.
4	And McClaren added: Sporting are technically very good - Portuguese sides always are.
4	But the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium - after the first game here - well look forward to it. Goalscorer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink added: It wasnt a particularly beautiful match to watch - but they made it difficult for us.
4	We didnt play well at all.
4	But you need a little bit of luck and I think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper.
4	I would have liked to play in Holland - that would have been a little bit special to me.
4	But so is going back to Portugal - Ill be playing against some lads I played with at Boavista. Rangers seal Old Firm win Goals from Gregory Vignal and Nacho Novo gave Rangers a scrappy victory at Celtic Park that moves them three points clear of the champions.
4	Rangers had rarely threatened until Celtic goalkeeper Rab Douglas let defender Vignals 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net.
4	Opposite number Ronald Waterreus had been Rangers hero, saving superbly from Craig Bellamy and John Hartson.
4	Striker Novo secured victory, lobbing Douglas with eight minutes remaining.
4	It ended Celtics 11-game unbeaten run at home in Old Firm derbies and gave Rangers manager Alex McLeish his first victory at the home of his Glasgow rivals.
4	Celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch, including twice already this season.
4	They started confidently, with new signing Bellamy, on loan from Newcastle United, given his Celtic debut up front with Wales international colleague John Hartson and Chris Sutton dropping into midfield.
4	It took Bellamy just four minutes to threaten, taking on Marvin Andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by Waterreus at the second attempt.
4	He had an even better chance after Hartson dispossesed Sotiris Kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat.
4	But Waterreus did well to beat away Bellamys disappointing low drive from 16 yards.
4	Waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to Hartson just inside the box and the Dutch goalkeeper made a brave block.
4	It was an Old Firm return for Barry Ferguson as McLeish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past Hibernian.
4	But Rangers found Celtic harder to break down and Douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break.
4	Dado Prso turned inside Neil Lennon only for the Celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive.
4	A great defensive header by Andrews prevented Hartson pouncing from five yards out.
4	Hartson foxed Vignal at the edge of the Rangers box, but the strikers shot on the turn was again beaten away by Waterreus.
4	Rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and Vignal, collecting a knock back from Fernando Ricksen, broke the deadlock, Douglas somehow letting the Frenchmans dipping drive slip through his grasp.
4	Novo pounced on a moments hesitation in the Celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from Ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing Douglas.
4	Ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin, but it could not prevent Rangers celebrations at the final whistle.
4	: Douglas, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Laursen, Petrov, Lennon, Sutton, Thompson, Bellamy, Hartson.
4	Subs: Marshall, Henchoz, Juninho Paulista, Lambert, Maloney, Wallace, McGeady.
4	: Waterreus, Hutton, Kyrgiakos, Andrews, Ball, Buffel, Ferguson, Ricksen, Vignal, Prso, Novo.
4	Subs: McGregor, Namouchi, Burke, Alex Rae, Malcolm, Thompson, Lovenkrands.
4	: M McCurry SFA awaits report over Mikoliunas The Scottish Football Association is awaiting referee Hugh Dallass report before acting against Hearts winger Saulius Mikoliunas.
4	Mikoliunas, 20, barged linesman Andy Davis, who had advised Dallas to award Rangers an injury-time penalty in Heartss 2-1 defeat at Tynecastle.
4	He was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we dont know if he did something else after the whistle.
4	We dont know how many red cards he was shown, said an SFA statement.
4	Hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch.
4	Rangers striker Dad Prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from Craig Gordon and leaving the Hearts keeper on the ground.
4	The SFA said: Once the referees report comes in then well immediately look at things.
4	We dont normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but were well aware of what happened here.
4	Prso was sent off for two cautions, and that will just be a one-match suspension. The SFA is certain to come down hard on Mikoliunas after Southamptons David Prutton was banned for 10-games on Wednesday by the English FA for shoving referee Alan Wiley.
4	Hearts boss John Robertson said: Mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referees chest and got a red card for it.
4	The officials have got to take into account the fact hes a young lad.
4	But people have got to take into account why he was incensed.
4	Why were 10,000 Hearts fans incensed? Why did nobody from the Rangers bench claim for a penalty kick? Rangers boss Alex McLeish accepted referee Dallas had no option but to send Prso off.
4	McLeish said: Im glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with Dado trying to get the ball back from Craig Gordon.
4	But it was over-zealousness and I dont think Hugh had any option. Palace threat over Cantona masks Manchester United fans wearing Eric Cantona masks will not be allowed in Selhurst Park on Saturday.
4	United fans are planning to mark the 10th anniversary of Cantonas infamous kung-fu kick on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons by wearing the masks.
4	But Palace stadium manager Kevin Corner has warned: If they wear them inside Selhurst Park they will be immediately rejected on safety grounds.
4	And no fans wearing Cantona masks will be allowed entry to the stadium. United fans had declared Saturday as Cantona Day and had planned to wear masks, that were popular during the Frenchmans time as a player at the Old Trafford club.
4	Cantona received a nine-month ban following the incident and Palace are keen to avoid an incident that would stir up ill feeling between the two sets of supporters.
4	Four months after the Cantona incident a Palace fan, Paul Nixon, was killed prior to an FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park.
4	Legendary Dutch boss Michels dies Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing total football, has died aged 77.
4	Referred to in the Netherlands as the General, Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany.
4	However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final.
4	Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971.
4	His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of total football to the world.
4	The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch.
4	Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football.
4	Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: He was one of the best coaches we had in history. The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen.
4	Michels, named coach of the century by world footballs governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward.
4	Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big. Jol joy at professional Cup win Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side.
4	We had the initiative but it wasnt easy.
4	It was a professional sort of performance, the Dutchman said.
4	Forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half, but at 2-0 they were dead and buried. Looking ahead to the quarter-final, Jol said: Newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult. However, he added that his side, who are four places above the Magpies in the Premiership, were not afraid of anyone.
4	Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his managers sentiments on the last-eight match.
4	Theyre on a high, but were confident and in the last few games weve played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win, he said.
4	He conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch.
4	It wasnt the best display but its all about the result, the Irishman said.
4	We knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions.
4	The pitch wasnt the best but we still tried to pass it.
4	We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come. Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance.
4	If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners youre going to have an uphill battle against a very good team, he said.
4	If we defend in the Championship like we did well not get another point.
4	We were organised but I felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didnt look like scoring. Owen delighted with Real display Michael Owen revelled in his return to the to the Real Madrid starting line-up and inspired a 3-1 win over Real Betis on Wednesday by scoring the first goal.
4	He said: I am happy I could play a game from the start again.
4	I felt good all though the game and it is obvious that I am happy to have scored another goal.
4	People have talked a lot about my performances and I think I have had some months that were not so good and others that were very good. Owen, starting his third successive La Liga match, converted a low cross from Santiago Solari.
4	Robert Carlos made it 2-0 at the break, smashing home an indirect free-kick.
4	Midfielder Edu reduced the deficit after half-time but Ivan Helguera headed past keeper Antonio Doblas to seal victory for his team.
4	Victory took Real to within six points of leaders Barcelona and Owen is confident Real can close the gap.
4	He added: We had several chances against Betis and I think we can get back in touch with Barcelona.
4	It is only six points between Barcelona and us and that is nothing.
4	If we can beat them at the Bernabeu (on 10 April), then it will be just three. Owen has scored nine league goals, one behind Reals top scorer Ronaldo.
4	Real had lost their previous two league games.
4	Ferguson fears Milan cutting edge Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his sides task against AC Milan would not be made any easier by the absence of Andriy Shevchenko.
4	Milans talismanic European footballer of the year misses Wednesdays Champions League first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone.
4	Its a loss (to Milan), but it could be worse if they didnt have such quality to bring in, Ferguson said.
4	How much they miss him I think theyll know tomorrow night. Ferguson said Milans front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders.
4	They can play Rui Costa and play Kaka forward.
4	They can bring Serginho in and they can play (Jon Dahl) Tomasson, he said.
4	Fergusons own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months.
4	Ruud is the best striker in Europe.
4	What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long, he said.
4	His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision. Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task.
4	We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that, he declared.
4	With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance. It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance.
4	As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited.
4	Looking at the draw, it is anyones trophy but we have every chance.
4	Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europes most prestigious club title two seasons ago.
4	Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation. Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory.
4	Its fundamental that we dont allow them to take control of the game.
4	Our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game, he said.
4	They have great quality in attack, they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them. Rush future at Chester uncertain Ian Rushs future as Chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant Mark Aizlewood refused a severance package.
4	Chester have won only two of their last 10 League games but Chairman Steve Vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the 43-year-old Liverpool legend.
4	Vaughan said: I offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them.
4	I havent because of the finances, so technically theyre still employees. Vaughan claimed that Aizlewood had verbally agreed to the offer.
4	But the Chester chairman added: After they discussed the offer with their solicitor, who also acts as their agent, they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement, which was disappointing. Rush was appointed at the end of August following the departure of former Liverpool team-mate Mark Wright, who guided Chester to the Conference title last season.
4	Chester were bottom of League Two when Rush took over but the former Liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life, taking the club into the third round of the FA cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for October.
4	Chesters downturn in form culminated in a 5-0 defeat at Shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the League Two relegation zone.
4	Reyes tricked into Real admission Jose Antonio Reyes has added to speculation linking him with a move from Arsenal to Real Madrid after falling victim to a radio prank.
4	The Spaniard believed he was talking to Real Madrid sporting director Emilio Butragueno when he allegedly berated his team-mates as bad people.
4	I wish I was playing for Real Madrid, the 21-year-old told Cadena Cope.
4	Hopefully it could happen.
4	I love the way Madrid play.
4	Im not happy with the way things are. The striker joined the Gunners from Seville for £17m at the start of 2004, but it has frequently been reported that he is homesick.
4	He began the season in superb form but has struggled to maintain his high standards as Arsenal have gradually lost the Premiership initiative to Manchester United and Chelsea.
4	If Im not (playing for Real) Im going to have to carry on playing with some bad people, he added.
4	Im sure there are none in the Real dressing room.
4	Im happy Madrid is interested in me because it has always been my dream since I was little to play there. Before the story surfaced, Reyes had moved to play down reports linking him with the Spanish giants, issuing a statement through Arsenal describing the speculation as flattering.
4	I have seen the stories in the media linking me with Real Madrid, he had said on Thursday lunchtime.
4	But not only am I under contract at Arsenal, I am happy here and committed to helping the team win more trophies. Butragueno, meanwhile, was angry at being impersonated by the radio disc jockey.
4	It is a disgrace, there is no foundation to this, he said.
4	He is an Arsenal player and we have to be respectful.
4	We have to be careful because of the rumours that appear in the news. Benitez joy as Reds take control Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez was satisfied after his teams 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute.
4	Before the game if you had said the score will be 3-1 I would have happily accepted that, said Benitez.
4	But you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level.
4	I have confidence that we can complete the task in Germany.
4	I am always confident and we must be positive. Benitez defended goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, whose failure to hold on to Dimitar Berbatovs weak drive allowed Franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the German team a lifeline for the second leg.
4	For me it was not Jerzy Dudeks fault, added Benitez.
4	He had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances, nobody would be talking about about their goal.
4	It would not have mattered.
4	If we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal.
4	In my opinion Jerzy played well, made two very fine saves - and I am happy with him.
4	If we lose 2-0 we are out but I think we can score in Germany - certainly one, and that will make all the difference. And the Liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper Steven Gerrard, who was suspended for the Anfield leg, back for the return in Germany.
4	Steven Gerrard is a key player for us, said Benitez.
4	When he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better - and the opposition pay special attention to him - which gives space for others.
4	Steven is one of the best players in the world, but I need a team that is not about just one player.
4	There must be 11 players on the pitch all doing well. Souness eyes summer move for Owen Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is lining up a summer move for England and Real Madrid striker Michael Owen.
4	He sees Owen as the ideal replacement for Alan Shearer, who is due to retire in the summer, although he hopes to persuade Shearer to carry on.
4	Michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him, he told BBC Newcastle.
4	He is a great centre-forward and only 25 but I dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at Real. Souness has also hinted he thinks Shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season.
4	He believes the prospect of breaking Jackie Milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision.
4	Milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while Shearer currently has 187 goals to his name.
4	Without giving too much away, I am confident he will be here next season, said Souness.
4	I cant imagine him leaving without breaking Jackie Milburns scoring record. Souness also revealed he tried to bring back Nolberto Solano during the January transfer window.
4	The Peruvian international was sold to Aston Villa a year ago but in the phone-in for BBC Newcastle, Souness said tried to re-sign him, but Villa were not interested in selling.
4	The former Rangers and Liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed.
4	Im after three, four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets, he said.
4	Dont think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `Who are we going to target now? Wenger dejected as Arsenal slump Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against Bayern Munich was our worst peformance in the Champions League.
4	Kolo Toures late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: The only positive is that we are still in the tie.
4	The players are really down in the dressing-room.
4	I feel we really turned in a bad performance.
4	At 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance. Goalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment. Wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: But there is enough time for crying.
4	I could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on.
4	In this job, you have good and bad nights.
4	This was a bad night - but I still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire. But Wengers Bayern counterpart Felix Magath was in no mood to celebrate either.
4	He said: I am far from happy despite the win.
4	My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.
4	Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf. Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: Do I blame myself for the third goal? As a goalkeeper, I always blame myself.
4	I just know the goals were very easy against us.
4	In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens.
4	It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances.
4	Everything is now possible. Stam spices up Man Utd encounter AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United know they made a mistake by selling him in 2001.
4	The sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-olds Dutchmans presence is sure to add spice to the fixture.
4	United made a mistake in selling me, Stam told Uefas Champions magazine.
4	I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me.
4	If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do.
4	You can be sold like cattle. Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001.
4	The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven.
4	But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime.
4	The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.
4	I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me, he said.
4	In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench.
4	I dont agree that players control the game.
4	There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down.
4	Whats the point? Wednesdays game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between Uniteds young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milans veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta.
4	Stam says Rooneys teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game.
4	We cant all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone, he said.
4	Starting late can be a good thing.
4	Some kids who start early get bored.
4	I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters.
4	It sounds strange but its a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do. Mourinho defiant on Chelsea form Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has insisted that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger would swap places with him.
4	Mourinhos side were knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle last Sunday before seeing Barcelona secure a 2-1 Champions League first-leg lead in the Nou Camp.
4	But he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals Arsenal and Manchester United could exploit.
4	They cannot speak to us about blips because theyre not in a better position than us, Mourinho said.
4	Do they want to change positions with us? We are top of the league by nine points and in the Carling Cup final.
4	The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup.
4	In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea. Mourinho said it was important to keep his teams results in perspective.
4	Dont try to put pressure on me because I am never under pressure, he warned.
4	We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and were out of the FA Cup but I dont think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat.
4	We are just 2-1 down at half-time. Asked if his Chelsea honeymoon was now over, Mourinho replied: I have had 20 years of honeymoons with my wife.
4	The day that this club is not happy with me is the day that I go. Hodgson relishes European clashes Former Blackburn boss Roy Hodgson says the Premiership should follow the rest of Europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the English elites bid for Champions League glory.
4	Hodgson - now in charge at Viking Stavanger - was at Liverpools clash with Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield on Tuesday as a member of Uefas technical committee.
4	Hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout Europe, although not in England - where the Champions League contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list.
4	But Hodgson told BBC Sport that while he believes the Premiership should embrace the idea, he does not expect it to cost the English representatives in the last 16 of the Champions League.
4	I just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge.
4	I am a fervent supporter of the break.
4	It gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season, which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the Champions League.
4	The other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage.
4	The bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the Premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the Champions League in February. Hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: As I said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.
4	And certainly if I was still a manager in England I would be supporting any calls for its introduction.
4	In pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards Christmas many players, having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot, find themselves getting very jaded.
4	The break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead.
4	The mental side is by far the most important thing. Hodgson added: The length of breaks can vary.
4	In Italy the break was very short.
4	You just took Christmas and New Year.
4	It was so short you didnt do anything.
4	You gave the players a week or 10 days off, then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game.
4	If it is longer, it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them. And Hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership.
4	He said: If we talk about football at elite level, which the Premiership is, then I would support a winter break.
4	If you examine the demands of the Premier League and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally. Coach Ranieri sacked by Valencia Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career.
4	The decision was taken at a board meeting following the sides surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup.
4	We understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate, said club president Juan Bautista.
4	Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach.
4	Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.
4	Things began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend.
4	That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest.
4	Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the Kings Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League.
4	The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year.
4	Cole faces lengthy injury lay-off Aston Villas Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.
4	The striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month.
4	Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge, said Villa boss David OLeary.
4	I wont be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week.
4	Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea. Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because OLeary had a shortage of strikers.
4	The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villas managers problems in that department.
4	Arsenal through on penalties Arsenal win 4-2 on penalties The Spanish goalkeeper saved from Alan Quinn and Jon Harley as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties.
4	Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Ashley Cole scored for Arsenal, while Andy Gray and Phil Jagielka were on target for the Blades.
4	Michael Tonge and Harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but Paddy Kenny was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay.
4	Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker Arturo Lupoli with Ljungberg up front.
4	It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as Tonge wasted a glorious chance.
4	Gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left Tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.
4	Arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although Ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by Cesc Fabregas.
4	Arsene Wenger introduced Quincy Owusu-Abeyie for the ineffective Lupoli at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact.
4	He ran clear after good work by Mathieu Flamini, but his finish was tame and Kenny saved easily.
4	Owusu-Abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by Fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by Kennys legs to save the Blades.
4	Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when Fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards.
4	It then took a brilliant tackle by Jagielka to deny Ljungberg as he was poised to strike.
4	Arsenal continued to press, and once again Kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas.
4	Neil Warnocks side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when Derek Gearys cross found Harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by Almunia.
4	Owusu-Abeyies pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for Ljungberg.
4	Pascal Cygan missed Arsenals best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post.
4	Arsenal sent on Jeremie Aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch.
4	Kolo Toures misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but Kenny once again blocked from a tight angle.
4	Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield Uniteds goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties.
4	Almunia was then Arsenals hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end.
4	Kenny, Geary, Morgan, Bromby, Harley, Liddell, Montgomery, Jagielka, Thirlwell, Tonge (Quinn 97), Gray.
4	Subs Not Used: Francis, Kabba, Shaw, Haystead. Morgan. Almunia, Lauren, Cygan, Senderos, Cole, Fabregas (Toure 90), Vieira, Flamini (Aliadiere 113), Clichy, Lupoli (Owusu-Abeyie 45), Ljungberg.

4	Ajax refuse to rule out Jol move Ajax have refused to reveal whether Tottenhams boss Martin Jol is on the Dutch champions shortlist to become the Amsterdam clubs new coach.
4	Jol, who has coached in his native Holland, has guided Spurs to the Premierships top eight.
4	An Ajax spokesman told BBC Sport: The coach must fit our profile - a coach who understands the Dutch league and offensive and distinctive football.
4	We need to find a solution soon, so someone is in place for next season. Ronald Koeman quit as Ajax boss last week after their exit from the Uefa Cup.
4	Jol has been linked with the vacant post at Ajax, with reports saying he has fallen out with Spurs sporting director Frank Arnesen.
4	But in a statement on Spurs website, Jol said: Im happy here, Im not in discussion with anyone else, I dont want to go elsewhere. Ajax have enlisted the help of Dutch legend Johann Cruyff, currently a consultant at Barcelona, to help find a new head coach.
4	Cruyff has admitted he has been impressed by the way former RFC Waalwijk coach Jol has turned round Spurs fortunes since taking over from Jacques Santini.
4	Tonny Bruins Slot and Ruud Krol are currently in charge of Ajax, who are third in the Dutch league.
4	Unclear future for striker Baros Liverpool forward Milan Baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss Rafa Benitezs plans after being dropped for the Carling Cup final.
4	Baros, who is Liverpools leading scorer this season, denied reports of a row with Benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench.
4	He told Czech newspaper Daily Sport: I dont know why I didnt play on Sunday.
4	I didnt argue with anybody.
4	I was disappointed but I am not thinking of leaving right now. The Czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to Chelsea after extra-time.
4	Baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the Millennium Stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up.
4	But his admission that he guessed something like this was going to happen on Saturday, will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with Benitez.
4	And although Baros insisted thoughts of quitting Anfield are not in my mind right now, he admitted everything is possible.
4	Prutton poised for lengthy FA ban Southamptons David Prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the Football Association.
4	The 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against Arsenal.
4	The first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee Alan Wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee Paul Norman.
4	And the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.
4	Paolo di Canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee Paul Alcock over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998.
4	Prutton will be joined at Wednesdays hearing by Saints boss Harry Redknapp, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player.
4	Redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio Jim Joyce and coach Denis Rofe shepherd the enraged Prutton away from referees assistant Norman.
4	David has made a big mistake and he knows it.
4	I cant condone what hes done.
4	He was out of order but he knows that, said Redknapp.
4	Hes a decent lad.
4	He over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere.
4	Off the pitch you couldnt meet a nicer lad. Prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to Arsenals Robert Pires, who was injured in a wild tackle by the Saints midfield man.
4	He said: Its an horrendous situation.
4	I apologise to the ref and linesman, who were only doing their job.
4	Ive also seen what happened to Pires leg and Im sorry for that as well. I apologise for the people who saw it.
4	I know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they dont pay money to see that sort of thing.
4	Its not a cop-out, but it was all a bit of a blur.
4	Sometimes you react and its beyond your control,  added Prutton.
4	Robben plays down European return Injured Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has insisted that he only has a 10% chance of making a return against Barcelona in the Champions League.
4	The 21-year-old has been sidelined since breaking a foot against Blackburn last month.
4	Chelsea face Barcelona at home on 8 March having lost 2-1 in the first leg.
4	And Robben told the Daily Star: It is not impossible that I will play against Barcelona but it is just a very, very small chance - about 10%. Robben has been an inspirational player for Chelsea this season following a switch from PSV Einhoven last summer.
4	He added: My recovery is going better than we expected a few weeks ago but I think the Barcelona game will come too soon.
4	I wont take any risks and come back too soon. Adrianos Chelsea link rejected Adrianos agent Gilmar Rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with Chelsea over the striker.
4	Chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about Inter Milans 22-year-old Brazilian star.
4	Rinaldi told BBC Sport from Rio de Janeiro: I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or Adriano.
4	Parma and Real Madrid are interested but theres nothing new there.
4	Their interest has been known for some time. Adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 Serie A appearances this season.
4	And Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had claimed that he was in Milan talking to Adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with Arsenal defender Ashley Cole.
4	Mourinho said he was just practising my Portuguese with him because I dont need strikers.
4	Rinaldi told BBC Sport: I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me.
4	If they want to, thats fine.
4	I can tell them what the situation is.
4	If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer. Inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of £40m on the head of Adriano, who joined them just over a year ago from Parma.
4	Real Madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot Ronaldo.
4	But Rinaldi said: I cannot give you a price that Inter would accept for Adriano.
4	Thats something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs. FA decides not to punish Mourinho The Football Association will take no action against Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho following his sending-off in Sundays Carling Cup final.
4	Mourinho, who was sent from the touchline for appearing to taunt Liverpool fans, has been reminded of his responsibilities to the game.
4	But the FA confirmed: There will be no further action taken in this matter. Mourinho claimed his silence gesture was aimed at the media, although they were on the other side of the ground.
4	The former Porto coach was forced to watch the climax of his sides 3-2 victory over Liverpool on television after being ushered away from the touchline by fourth official Phil Crossley.
4	His gesture came after Chelseas equaliser on 79 minutes courtesy of a Steven Gerrard own goal.
4	Mourinho still faces an FA investigation into his allegation that Manchester Uniteds players cheated during Januarys Carling Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge.
4	And Uefa could also launch disciplinary action following Mourinhos failure to attend a compulsory post-match press conference after Chelseas Champions League defeat at Barcelona last week.
4	In addition, some time this month, Chelsea must also answer a charge of failing to control their players during the Premiership win at Blackburn in February.
4	And a charge of failing to control their supporters following a Carling Cup meeting with West Ham earlier this season is still to be heard.
4	The Premier League is also continuing investigations into allegations Chelsea officials tapped up Arsenal defender Ashley Cole in January.
4	Aragones angered by racism fine Spain coach Luis Aragones is furious after being fined by The Spanish Football Federation for his comments about Thierry Henry.
4	The 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (£2,060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty.
4	I am not guilty, nor do I accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport, he said.
4	Im not a racist and Ive never lacked sporting decorum.
4	Ive never done that and I have medals for sporting merit. Aragones was handed the fine on Tuesday after making racist remarks about Henry to Arsenal team-mate and Spanish international Jose Reyes last October.
4	The Spanish Football Federation at first declined to take action against Aragones, but was then requested to do so by Spains anti-violence commission.
4	The fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence.
4	Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined £15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones punishment was too lenient.
4	You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should, Wenger said.
4	He shouldnt have said what he said, and how much money is enough, I dont know but it doesnt look a big punishment. However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair.
4	I have been treated like Islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter Manolete), said Aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions.
4	I have not liked one thing about this whole affair and I do not agree with the sanction.
4	They have looked for a scapegoat. Spains anti-violence commission must now ratify the Spanish FAs decision and has until next week to announce its verdict.
4	Aragones has 10 days to appeal, and the commission can also appeal.
4	Alberto Flores, president of the Spanish FAs disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt Aragones was a racist nor had acted in a racist way. A fine, the highest we could apply, is sufficient punishment.
4	Suspension would have been a bit exaggerated, Flores told sports daily Marca.
4	Boro suffer Morrison injury blow Middlesbrough midfielder James Morrison has been ruled out for up to eight weeks after an operation on Tuesday.
4	The 18-year-old, who has played in 13 of the clubs last 14 games, had surgery to repair a double hernia.
4	A club spokesman confirmed: It is a bilateral sportsmans hernia, which was operated on yesterday. Morrison was sent for scans after being substituted at half-time during Boros 2-1 UEFA Cup win over Graz AK in which he scored the equaliser.
4	His injury is the latest blow for the Teessiders, who have been without Gaizka Mendieta, George Boateng and Mark Viduka for extended periods.
4	Meanwhile, the kick-off time for Boros Uefa Cup match at Sporting Lisbon on 17 March has been brought forward from 2115 GMT to 1945 GMT.
4	Mourinho receives Robson warning Sir Bobby Robson has offered Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho some advice on coping under pressure.
4	The pair worked together at Barcelona and Porto and Robson had a word of warning for his protege.
4	It has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous, but sometimes you have to have a bit of humility and learn how to lose, said Robson.
4	It is when it goes against you and you get a bit of bad luck that you learn, and hell get it straight. Robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of Newcastle.
4	Jose is doing very well at the moment, Robson added of the man who worked for him for six years.
4	He has got one pot - possibly two to follow - a big game against Barcelona to come and I cannot see them losing their lead in the Premiership.
4	They are in a good position and I would expect them to go on and win it, which is a wonderful achievement.
4	What has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future.
4	If he is intelligent, he will take it on board - and he is very intelligent.
4	He will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months.
4	Before that, it was all about winning. Robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against Mourinho.
4	I am not in a hurry to take the wrong job, but I am ready to take the right job and I feel there is another job in me, he added.
4	I know the area I am capable of working in and of course I would like a job in the Premiership if one was available.
4	It would not worry me if I had to pit my wits against Jose.
4	But it is not just a case of him and me against one another.
4	It would be his team against my team - but I would not be afraid of that. QPR keeper Day heads for Preston Queens Park Rangers keeper Chris Day is set to join Preston on a months loan.
4	Day has been displaced by the arrival of Simon Royce, who is in his second month on loan from Charlton.
4	QPR have also signed Italian Generoso Rossi.
4	Rs manager Ian Holloway said: Some might say its a risk as he cant be recalled during that month and Simon Royce can now be recalled by Charlton.
4	But I have other irons in the fire.
4	I have had a yes from a couple of others should I need them. Days Rangers contract expires in the summer.
4	Meanwhile, Holloway is hoping to complete the signing of Middlesbrough defender Andy Davies - either permanently or again on loan - before Saturdays match at Ipswich.
4	Davies impressed during a recent loan spell at Loftus Road.
4	Holloway is also chasing Bristol City midfielder Tom Doherty.
4	Cudicini misses Carling Cup final Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini will miss Sundays Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle.
4	The Italian was sent off for bringing down Shola Ameobi in the final minute of Sundays match.
4	Blues boss Jose Mourinho had promised to pick Cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper Petr Cech.
4	The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.
4	Cudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but Petr Cech has established himself as first choice for Mourinho since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004.
4	The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running.
4	But Mourinho has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelseas run to the final.
4	Beattie return calms attack fears Everton striker James Beattie has been declared fit for training on Tuesday, despite suffering an alleged assault last Saturday.
4	Beattie, 27, is not believed to be as seriously hurt as some reports have suggested after being the victim of an unprovoked assault in Birmingham.
4	He was on a night out with his girlfriend and two friends following Evertons 3-1 win over Aston Villa.
4	He was shaken but not badly injured, said Everton spokesman Ian Ross.
4	He added: He did speak to the police but will not be pressing charges.
4	He has spoken to manager David Moyes about what happened. Beattie was suspended for the win at Aston Villa after his red card against Chelsea and he will be available again for the Merseyside derby at Liverpool on 20 March.
4	Keegan hails comeback king Fowler Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.
4	The 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Mondays 3-2 win at Norwich.
4	He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did, Keegan said.
4	He has worked hard to get back to where he is now. The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.
4	Fowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173).
4	And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward.
4	He can get better if we can supply him better, added Keegan.
4	People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face. Fowlers double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards.
4	I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington, he said.
4	His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm.
4	I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership.
4	The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know. Thompson says Gerrard should stay Liverpool legend Phil Thompson has pleaded with Steve Gerrard to reject any overtures from Chelsea.
4	The ex-Reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at Chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success.
4	He told BBC Radio Five Live: Liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to Steve in the end.
4	But it wouldnt have that same sweet feeling at Chelsea, where its all money-orientated and about simply buying the best. Thompson reacted sharply to some Liverpool supporters, who criticised Gerrards performance in the Carling Cup final against Chelsea.
4	A number of fans questioned Gerrards commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in Liverpools 3-2 defeat as his first goal for Chelsea.
4	Thompson added: I heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical, absolutely outrageous.
4	Stevie carried the club last year and this year.
4	Hes always put Liverpool first. Thompson, who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two European Cup triumphs during his Anfield playing career, is confident that the lure of Champions League football will keep Gerrard at Anfield.
4	I hope Champions League football will beckon for Liverpool - either as winners or as finishing fourth in the Premiership - and he will commit himself.
4	There has been a lot of soul-searching the way things have gone lately.
4	I hope hes hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but I hope it is to the benefit of Steven Gerrard and I hope it is worthwhile for Liverpool. Cole refuses to blame van Persie Ashley Cole has refused to blame Robin van Persie for leaving Arsenal with no fully-fit strikers for the FA Cup fifth round replay at Sheffield United.
4	Van Persie is suspended alongside Dennis Bergkamp and Jose Antonio Reyes after being sent off at Southampton when Arsenal had a numerical advantage.
4	Thierry Henry is ruled out with an Achilles tendon injury but Cole said: No-one is putting the blame on Robin.
4	Its just something that happens on the spur of the moment. Cole added: Ive done it before and I hope they didnt blame me for anything.
4	Of course hell learn.
4	Ive been sent off a couple of times now and its just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds.
4	Freddie Ljungberg is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either Arturo Lupoli, Quincy Owusu-Abeyie or Jeremie Aliadiere.
4	Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: Freddie is an option but we need a second striker.
4	I have to decide whether it will be Aliadiere, Quincy or Lupoli who will start with him up front.
4	Those three will be involved. Arsenal are also without winger Robert Pires, who sustained an ankle injury at St Marys.
4	Wenger added: It doesnt look like anything is fractured, but it is a good ankle sprain.
4	It does not look like Pires will be ready for two to three weeks. Blackburn v Burnley Ewood Park Tuesday, 1 March 2000 GMT Howard Webb (South Yorkshire) home to Leicester in the quarter-finals But defender Andy Todd is suspended and could be replaced by Dominic Matteo - if he recovers from a hamstring injury.
4	Burnley have major injury concerns over Frank Sinclair and John McGreal.
4	Michael Duff looks set to continue at right-back with John Oster in midfield and Micah Hyde is expected to recover from a knee injury.
4	- Blackburn boss Mark Hughes: Burnley are resolute and have individual talent but I fully expect us to progress.
4	I thought we were comfortable in the first game and never thought we were under pressure.
4	Its a competition we want to progress in and we are doing okay.
4	If we beat Burnley, we have a home tie against another lower league club (Leicester). - Burnley boss Steve Cotterill: They will be fresh and well be tired.
4	That is an honest opinion but our lads just might be able to get themselves up for one more big game.
4	The atmosphere at the last game was very hot - a good verbal contest.
4	Our fans will not need whipping up for this game.
4	I just want them to help us as much as they can in a positive way. KEY MATCH STATS - BLACKBURN ROVERS against Bolton is part two of an East Lancashire hotpot that didnt turn out to be that spicy when first staged on a Sunday lunchtime the weekend before last, and resulted in a scrappy goalless draw.
4	- Rovers, who are aiming to win the Cup for a seventh time in their history and first time in 77 years, face another replay against Championship opposition after eventually disposing of Cardiff at Ewood Park in the third round.
4	But theyve not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the Premiership for nine years, since Ipswich - then in the second tier - defeated them 0-1 after extra time in a third round replay at Ewood Park on 16 January 1996.
4	History is on Rovers side.
4	When they last met their near neighbours in the FA Cup 45 years ago, it also required an Ewood Park replay, which the home side won 2-0, and when they last met in the League, Rovers did the double.
4	They first won their Nationwide Division One trip to Turf Moor 0-2 four seasons ago, and then thrashed the Clarets on home soil 5-0.
4	- Manager Mark Hughes, who won the Cup four times as a player, is aiming to steer Rovers into the quarter-finals for the second time in 12 years, and first time since the 2000/2001 season.
4	Success here, and victory home to Leicester in the next round, could see Rovers in the semi-finals without having played Premiership opposition.
4	- BURNLEY make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals, determined to send Blackburn the same way as Liverpool in the third round.
4	But having failed to pull off another shock at Turf Moor, it could be that the Championship outfit - 17 places inferior on the League ladder - have missed their best opportunity.
4	Having said that, Burnley are yet to concede a goal in this Cup run.
4	- Steve Cotterills Clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years, and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years.
4	That was in the season before last, when they disposed of Premiership Fulham at this fifth round stage.
4	- While Blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie, Burnley have had two League outings away from home, drawing 1-1 at Derby and losing 1-0 at Preston.
4	That takes their winless run to four games.
4	The combatants from one-time prosperous mill towns, are both founder members of the Football League.
4	HEAD TO HEAD 16th PREM WINNERS (six times) 13th Championship WINNERS (once) Brentford v Southampton Griffin Park Tuesday, 1 March 1945 GMT Barry Knight (Kent) home to Manchester United in the quarter-finals Midfielder Andrew Frampton and striker Deon Burton are both slight doubts with hamstring injuries, but should be fit Saints are missing their entire first-choice midfield of Jamie Redknapp, Graeme Le Saux, Nigel Quashie and David Prutton.
4	Anders Svensson and Matt Oakley are likely replacements with Kevin Phillips also scheduled to start, with Henri Camara rested.
4	- Brentford boss Martin Allen: After conceding eight goals in our last three matches, I have to admit Im not very confident.
4	Theres no doubt were the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently its not looking good.
4	Southampton have just drawn with the Premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already. - Southampton boss Harry Redknapp: We know they can give us problems.
4	Brentford have done well but we are the Premiership side and should have the better players.
4	Staying in the Premiership is our priority.
4	We want to win, of course we do.
4	Well battle but if it comes to a football match I think well win. KEY MATCH STATS - BRENTFORD are the lowest ranked club left in the FA Cup.
4	Theyre on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarter-finals for the fourth time in their history 16 years ago.
4	Now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them.
4	Victory over Premiership strugglers Southampton, would bring the mighty Manchester United to Griffin Park and a gigantic pay day for the sole League One survivors.
4	- Martin Allens brave side came back from two goals down at St Marys to earn a deserved replay.
4	Southampton striker Henri Camara scored twice from close range to put the Saints in command, but Isaiah Rankin hit back just before half time, and Sam Sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes.
4	- The Londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent League outings - three each in losing away to Hartlepool and drawing at home to Sheffield Wednesday.
4	But they havent lost in six League and Cup games on home turf - winning three and drawing three since the reverse to Torquay on Boxing Day.
4	- SOUTHAMPTON go into this tie on the back of an eventful Premiership match with Arsenal on Saturday.
4	An angry David Prutton pushed referee Alan Wiley after being shown the red card, but his side still came back to draw 1-1.
4	It was Saints fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions, but didnt lift them out of the relegation zone.
4	The retention of their ever present Premier League status must be the number one priority, irrespective of the rewards that success against Brentford would bring.
4	- Victory here would set up a repeat of the 1976 final, when Saints astounded the football world by defeating Tommy Dochertys Manchester United courtesy of Bobby Stokes famous winner.
4	They also knocked out the Red Devils in 1991 on penalties in the fourth round.
4	But to write another chapter in their FA Cup history, the Solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since Rotherham, from the second level, beat them 2-1 in a third round tie at Millmoor on 16 January 2002.
4	Southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago.
4	Fulham were then in the Second Division, when they won a third round replay at Craven Cottage 1-0 on 13 January 1999.
4	- To get to within two matches of a second visit to the Millennium Stadium in three years for the final, Harry Redknapp must guide his side past a club 36 places inferior on the League ladder, and a manager 19 years his junior, who played under him at West Ham.
4	HEAD TO HEAD 10th League One QUARTER-FINALS (four times) 18th PREM WINNERS (once) Desailly backs Blues revenge trip Marcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday.
4	The French star was part of the Chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the Nou Camp in the Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2000.
4	Things will be totally different this time, he told BBC Sport.
4	Now everyone knows about Chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them.
4	They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona. Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago.
4	The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola.
4	But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.
4	Former Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership.
4	Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young, the 36-year-old said.
4	We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes.
4	It would not happen now.
4	This team has a new motivation and a different mentality. World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge.
4	He was signed for £4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri.
4	But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003.
4	Desailly says the Russians arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success.
4	The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players, he said.
4	Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win.
4	Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season. Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football.
4	He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea.
4	He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry.
4	So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta.
4	Im happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level, he said.
4	I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play.
4	And its amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time. Desailly backs Blues revenge trip Marcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday.

4	And its amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time. Mourinho expects fight to finish Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho expects the Champions League clash with Barcelona to be a fight to the finish.
4	Mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last 16 in the Nou Camp.
4	He said: I wouldnt be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time.
4	I have to defend what is mine and the Champions League is mine at the moment.
4	Im the last manager to have won it. Mourinho never coached Barcelona, assisting both Sir Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal.
4	But he is not envious, insisting: I dont have to be jealous about Barcelona because they have 100 years of history and have won the European Cup once.
4	I have been managing for five years and I have the same amount of Champions League trophies to my name. Barcelona star Ronaldinho admitted: I think that it is going to be a difficult match for us because Chelsea have a good team full of big stars.
4	I have seen Chelsea a few times on television, tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counter-attack.
4	They pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game.
4	I believe they are the two strongest teams in Europe.
4	Nevertheless, Barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the Nou Camp, where they have to face the likes of Real Madrid each season.
4	It is a special game, the atmosphere in the city changes, there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not a lot of difference, Ronaldinho added.
4	We are only thinking of winning the match with all respect to the opposition. Cup holders Man Utd visit Everton Holders Manchester United and Premiership leaders Chelsea both face difficult away ties against Premiership opposition in the FA Cup fifth round.
4	United were drawn against Everton, while Chelsea face a trip to Newcastle.
4	Brentford and Hartlepool - the only sides left from outside the top two divisions - will replay for the right to travel to Southampton.
4	Burnleys reward for a place in the last 16 was a home tie against Lancashire rivals Blackburn.
4	The tie between Manchester United and Everton could see the return of teenage striker Wayne Rooney to his former club for the first time since his acrimonious £27m move.
4	Nottingham Forest boss Gary Megson could face a trip back to old club West Brom if they come through their fourth-round replay against Tottenham.
4	Arsenal were handed a potential home tie against fellow Londoners West Ham, providing the Hammers come through their replay against Sheffield United.
4	Charlton will play Leicester and Bolton await the winners of the Derby-Fulham replay.
4	: Bolton v Derby or Fulham West Bromwich Albion or Tottenham v Nottingham Forest Everton v Manchester United Charlton Athletic v Leicester City Burnley v Blackburn Southampton v Brentford or Hartlepool Newcastle v Chelsea Arsenal v West Ham or Sheffield United Ties to be played on 19/20 February.
4	Candela completes Bolton switch Bolton boss Sam Allardyce has signed Roma defender Vincent Candela on a five-month deal.
4	The 31-year-old former France international gave his last press conference as a Roma player on Monday, anouncing his move to Bolton.
4	I have signed a five-month contract with Bolton, said Candela, who will travel to England on Tuesday.
4	In June I will decide whether to continue to play for Bolton or retire from professional football. Allardyce hopes Candelas arrival will relieve Boltons injury crisis after defender Nicky Hunt limped out injured during Oldhams 1-0 win against Oldham in the FA Cup on Sunday.
4	In light of what has happened to Nicky Hunt, with his injury, it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back, Allardyce said.
4	He has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the World Cup in 1998.
4	He has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the Premiership.
4	He can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately right-footed he has played the majority of his career at left-back. Candela, who was a member of the Roma side that won the title in 2001, has made only seven league appearances this season for Luigi del Neris side.
4	Stuart joins Norwich from Addicks Norwich have signed Charlton midfielder Graham Stuart until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee.
4	It was a very easy decision to make, the 34-year-old told Norwichs website.
4	The attraction for me was to continue to play in the Premiership. Canaries boss Nigel Worthington added: Im delighted that Graham will be joining us until the end of the season.
4	Hes gives us a wealth of experience.
4	Hopefully, he can be part of keeping us in the Premier League. Stuart has extensive top-flight experience with Everton, Chelsea and Charlton and can play across the midfield positions.
4	He joins Norwich with the Norfolk club second-from-bottom in the Premiership, but Stuart is confident that the Carrow Road outfit have a bright future.
4	Ive been very impressed with the facilities here.
4	Its obviously a very well run football club with excellent facilities and Ive always enjoyed playing at Carrow Road, he added.
4	Its a nice compact ground with a good atmosphere and hopefully I can help give the fans something else to cheer. Stuart, a former England Under-21 international, made 110 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 18 goals, before joining Everton.
4	He won the FA Cup with the Toffees in 1995 and remains a hero at Goodison Park after his 81st-minute winner against Wimbledon saved Everton from relegation in 1994.
4	Stuart spent just over four years at Goodison Park, making 125 senior appearances and scoring 25 goals, before signing for Sheffield United - where he scored 12 goals in 68 appearances.
4	After signing for Charlton he made 164 appearances, scoring 23 times, but recently he has been battling a back problem and had not played for the Londoners for three months before heading to Norwich.
4	Celtic make late bid for Bellamy Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy is discussing a possible short-term loan move to Celtic, BBC Sport understands.
4	The Welsh striker has rejected a move to Birmingham after falling out with Magpies manager Graeme Souness.
4	The Toon boss vowed Bellamy would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against Arsenal.
4	Celtic are in no position to match Birminghams £6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit Bellamy while he considers his future.
4	According to Bellamys agent, the player dismissed a permanent move to Birmingham.
4	And it is unlikely that Newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another Premiership club.
4	Bellamy was fined two weeks wages after a live TV interview in which he accused Souness of lying, following a very public dispute about what position Bellamy should play in the side.
4	Souness said: He cant play for me ever again.
4	He has been a disruptive influence from the minute I walked into this football club.
4	He cant go on television and accuse me of telling lies. Chairman Freddy Shepherd described Bellamys behaviour as totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional.
4	Campbell lifts lid on United feud Arsenals Sol Campbell has called the rivalry between Manchester United and the Gunners bitter and personal.
4	Past encounters have stirred up plenty of ill-feeling between the sides and they meet again at Highbury on Tuesday.
4	It is just more bitter and personal against United, the defender told The Guardian newspaper.
4	Theres an edge.
4	After all that has happened, if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins, especially because of how we lost to them up there. Last October, Arsenal lost 2-0 at Old Trafford, which ended a record 49-match unbeaten league run and sparked a mini-crisis, with the Gunners winning only three of their next 10 games.
4	It had a psychological impact on us, but again because of the way we were defeated, added the 30-year-old, referring to a controversial penalty award for Uniteds first goal.
4	That was far more upsetting, losing like that, because they just seem to get away with it.
4	You try and balance out over the course of a season but Ive had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder. With tensions spilling over afterwards - United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on.
4	Everyone at Arsenal has been waiting for this game, said Campbell.
4	We are up for this one. Speaking on his long-term plans, Campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35.
4	Im 30 now and in five years time I wont be in this country - thats definite.
4	Italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football.
4	Spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most.
4	Im starting a little with French, of course. Rovers reject third Ferguson bid Blackburn have rejected a third bid from Rangers for Scotland captain Barry Ferguson, BBC Sport has learnt.
4	It is thought Blackburn want £6m for the midfielder but chief executive John Williams has confirmed the club are still in dialogue with Rangers.
4	The 26-year-old has already handed in a transfer request at Ewood Park as he seeks a return to Ibrox.
4	But the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for Ferguson, who moved to Lancashire in 2003 for £6.5m.
4	On Thursday Rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of £4m.
4	Blackburn have said all along that they want £6m for the midfielder and Williams has rejected proposals from Rangers over a player-swap deal.
4	Williams said: We are in dialogue with Glasgow Rangers but we have no agreement. The negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on Monday, when the winter transfer window shuts.
4	Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking unlikely before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal.
4	We have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with Glasgow Rangers, he added.
4	The way things are looking, I think it is unlikely we are going to.
4	The ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment. It is understood that Blackburn accepted a £5m offer for Ferguson from Everton at the weekend.
4	But the player is determined to return to Scotland and rejected a move to Goodison Park.
4	Ferguson did not play in the FA Cup win over Colchester on Saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with Rovers boss Mark Hughes claiming it had been an emotional and difficult time for the player.
4	SA return to Mauritius Top seeds South Africa return to the scene of one of their most embarrassing failures when they face the Seychelles in the Cosafa Cup next month.
4	Last year Bafana Bafana were humbled in the first by minnows Mauritius who beat them 2-0 in Curepipe.
4	Coach Stuart Baxter and his squad will return to Curepipe face the Seychelles in their first game of the new-look regional competition.
4	The format of the event has been changed this year after the entry of the Seychelles, who have taken the number of participants to 13.
4	The teams are now divided into three group of four and play knock-out matches on successive days to determine the group champions.
4	Mauritius host the first group, and their opponents are Madagascar, the Seychelles and South Africa.
4	Bafana Bafana play the Seychelles before Mauritius take on Madagascar in a double-header on 26 February.
4	The two winners return to the New George V stadium the next day and the victor of the group decider advances to Augusts final mini-tournament.
4	The second group will be hosted in Namibia in April.
4	It comprises Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and the hosts.
4	In June, former champions Zambia will host Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland in the third group in Lusaka.
4	The three group winners will then join title holders Angola for the last of the mini-tournaments in August, where the winners will be crowned.
4	Seychelles v South Africa Mauritius v Madagascar Winners meet in final match Mozambique v Zimbabwe Namibia v Botswana Winners meet in final match Lesotho v Malawi Zambia v Swaziland Winners meet in final match Tottenham bid &#163;8m for Forest duo Nottingham Forest have confirmed they have received an £8m bid from Tottenham for Andy Reid and Michael Dawson.
4	Reid rejected a move to Southampton after Forest accepted a cash-plus-players offer while Spurs had made previous bids for the 22-year-old.
4	Spurs had also made an undisclosed offer for 21-year-old defender Dawson.
4	Forest chief executive Mark Arthur said: Weve received an £8m bid from Spurs for the two players and were considering the offer. Southamptons offer for Republic of Ireland international Reid comprised £3m-plus and two players - Brett Ormerod and Darren Kenton.
4	Spurs had seen previous bids of £3m, £4m and £5m for Reid rejected by the Championship club.
4	Redknapps Saints face Pompey tie New Southampton manager Harry Redknapp faces an immediate reunion with his old club Portsmouth after they were drawn together in the FA Cup fourth round.
4	Exeter City face a home tie against Middlesbrough if they can see off holders Manchester United in a replay.
4	Oldhams reward for beating Manchester City is a home tie with Bolton, while Yeovil will be away to Charlton.
4	Chelsea host Birmingham, Tottenham travel to West Brom and Arsenal will entertain Championship side Wolves.
4	Saints boss Redknapp was upbeat about the draw despite having to face the club he walked out on just six weeks ago.
4	Ive said before, I can walk away from Portsmouth with my head held high, Im proud of what I did there and no one can take that away from me, said Redknapp.
4	Maybe Ill be in for some stick, theres always some of that but well get on with it and its only a game of football. Birmingham manager Steve Bruce admitted their trip to Stamford Bridge to face Premiership leaders Chelsea was the toughest draw possible.
4	Bruce said: Im still in shock.
4	Weve given good accounts of ourselves against Chelsea in the past and played well when we lost 1-0 at home at the start of the season - but thats the past.
4	But its the best competition in the world as far as I am concerned and we will give it our best shot. Brentford boss Martin Allen remained cautious despite his sides favourable draw - a home tie with either Hartlepool or Boston.
4	The best thing is, its a home game.
4	However, we know that whoever we play it is going to be a really tough game, said Allen.
4	But its not about the opposition, its about us.
4	We all want to get through to the next round and face a massive team, thats the way it is. Meanwhile, the BBC has confirmed it will be televising Exeters replay with Man Utd live on Wednesday 19 January, from 1930 on BBC One.
4	Derby v Watford or Fulham Man Utd or Exeter v Middlesbrough Cardiff or Blackburn v Colchester Chelsea v Birmingham West Ham v Sheff Utd Oldham v Bolton Arsenal v Wolverhampton Everton v Sunderland Nottm Forest v Peterborough Brentford v Hartlepool or Boston Reading or Swansea v Leicester or Blackpool Burnley or Liverpool v Bournemouth Southampton v Portsmouth West Brom v Tottenham Newcastle v Coventry Charlton v Yeovil Real in talks over Gravesen move Real Madrid are closing in on a £2m deal for Evertons Thomas Gravesen after the Danes agent travelled to Spain to hold talks about a move.
4	John Sivabaek told BBC Sport: Im here to listen to what Real have to say.
4	Nothing has been agreed, but this is a big opportunity for any player. The 28-year-olds contract expires in the summer, but Real want a quick deal.
4	Sivabaek added: I will be meeting Real on Wednesday.
4	There is serious interest, but it is Evertons hands. Everton must decide whether to cash in now on the Denmark midfield man, or risk losing him for nothing in the summer.
4	Manager David Moyes has defiantly claimed that he expects Gravesen to still be at Everton when the transfer window closes at the end of January.
4	Moyes said: I speak to Tommy regularly and we know where we are at.
4	Theres been no contact.
4	We dont want to lose him. Real Madrid general manager Arrigo Sacchi is the driving force behind the move, convincing vice-president Emilio Butragueno and new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo that Gravesen is the right man for the Bernabeu.
4	Everton must weigh up whether it is worth taking the money on offer for Real and risk their own ambitions for European football.
4	Gravesen has been outstanding as Everton have established themselves in the Premierships top four this season.
4	Klinsmann issues Lehmann warning Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann has warned goalkeeper Jens Lehmann he may have to quit Arsenal to keep his World Cup dreams alive.
4	Lehmann is understudy to Oliver Kahn in the German squad, but has lost his place to Manuel Alumnia at Highbury.
4	Klinsmann said: It will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club.
4	If Jens is not Arsenals number one keeper, that is a problem for me.
4	He must be playing regularly. Lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the Germany squad when the country hosts the World Cup in 2006.
4	Klinsmann added: If he is not playing regularly he cannot be Germanys number one keeper, or even number two keeper.
4	The situation for Jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at Arsenal.
4	This could be critical if it remains the same during next season. Juninho demand for ONeill talks Juninhos agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin ONeill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.
4	Brian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination.
4	But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions.
4	Juninho wants assurances that he will return to ONeills first-team plans.
4	He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer.
4	Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would desperately like to stay at Celtic but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.
4	The agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-olds father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil.
4	Juninhos father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren.
4	I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesnt want to go there, said Hassel.
4	He wants to stay in Britain.
4	In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic. Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest.
4	It was a thought at one stage, he said.
4	If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you.
4	He is a fan of Kevin Keegans style of play.
4	It would not be a bad move for him. Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasnt happened.
4	If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go.
4	That would be good for the club and good for me.
4	If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes. The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin ONeill since his move to Celtic Park.
4	I cant understand why I am in this situation, he continued.
4	When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support. Wenger signs new deal Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has signed a new contract to stay at the club until May 2008.
4	Wenger has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a long-term contract that takes him beyond the opening of Arsenals new stadium in two years.
4	He said: Signing a new contract just rubber-stamps my desire to take this club forward and fulfil my ambitions.
4	I still have so much to achieve and my target is to drive this club on.
4	These are exciting times for Arsenal. The 55-year-old Frenchman told Arsenals website www.arsenal.com: My intention has always been clear.
4	I love this club and am very happy here. Wenger has won the title and the FA Cup three times each during his reign.
4	Chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: We are absolutely delighted that Arsene has signed an extension to his contract.
4	Since his arrival in 1996, he has revolutionised the club both on and off the pitch.
4	As well as the six major honours hes won during his time here, Arsene has been a leading influence behind all the major initiatives at the club including the construction of our new training centre and also our new stadium.
4	The club has continued to reap the benefits of Arsenes natural eye for unearthing footballing talent.
4	We currently have a fantastic crop of young players coming through the ranks together with a number of world-class players who are playing a wonderful brand of football. Meanwhile, Arsenal director Danny Fiszman is looking for Wenger to stay beyond 2008.
4	When we come towards the end of his contract we will both review the situation.
4	Im sure we will want him to stay on and I hope he will too, said Fiszman.
4	FA probes crowd trouble The FA is to take action after trouble marred Wednesdays Carling Cup tie between Chelsea and West Ham.
4	Police in riot gear were confronted by a section of the West Ham support after the match which the Blues won 1-0.
4	Mateja Kezman, the scorer of Chelseas goal, needed treatment on a head injury during the match after being hit by a missile, believed to be a coin.
4	A spokeswoman for Chelsea said the club would await the referees report before deciding on its course of action.
4	Kezman was forced off the field to receive treatment on a cut above his eye but was able to continue.
4	Chelsea assistant boss Steve Clarke said: I would rather talk about the football but we think it was something thrown from the crowd.
4	He did not require stitches. West Ham boss Alan Pardew said: Its a shame because I thought there was good English banter in the crowd.
4	Theres big rivalry between the two clubs and it is a shame if thats happened.
4	From where I was standing I didnt see any trouble. Former Hammers star Joe Cole also had a plastic bottle thrown at him, while Frank Lampard was pelted with coins as he was preparing to take a penalty.
4	Lampards spot-kick was saved to the delight of the Hammers fans, who have still not forgiven him for leaving Upton Park.
4	The FA will seek reports from the clubs and the police, and will review video evidence and the referees report.
4	Police in riot gear battled with West Ham fans in the Matthew Harding stand and at least one supporter required treatment.
4	Fans are also thought to have clashed outside the ground after the game.
4	Scotland Yard said there had been 11 arrests for alleged public order, drugs and offensive weapon offences.
4	The FA is already looking into the trouble at Tuesdays heated Carling Cup tie between Millwall and Liverpool.
4	Edu describes tunnel fracas Arsenals Edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed Manchester Uniteds win over the Gunners.
4	The Brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.
4	I saw people being pulled apart, people pushing, pointing and shouting, he told Uefas official website.
4	The United players were trying to wind us up about the result but I didnt see any soup being thrown at anyone. However, Edu tried to play down the incidents, adding: There was nothing that I havent seen in Brazilian derbies.
4	Derby matches in Brazil are worse.
4	I like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry. But Edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of Uniteds challenges during the game, particularly on Jose Antonio Reyes.
4	I think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than United, he said.
4	Reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and Gary Neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off. Following the game, the Football Association said it would look into events in the tunnel.
4	It also charged Ruud van Nistelrooy with serious foul play while Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee.
4	Chelsea sack Mutu Chelsea have sacked Adrian Mutu after he failed a drugs test.
4	The 25-year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in October.
4	Chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for Mutu, a ñ5.8m signing from Parma last season, who may face a two-year suspension.
4	A statement from Chelsea explaining the decision read:We want to make clear that Chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs. Mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at Stamford Bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach Jose Mourinho.
4	Chelseas statement added: This applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called recreational drugs.
4	They have no place at our club or in sport.
4	In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the clubs social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company.
4	Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules.
4	The club totally supports the FA in strong action on all drugs cases. Fifas disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban.
4	And the sports world governing body has re-iterated their stance over Mutus failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities.
4	Fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the English FA have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it, said a Fifa spokesman.
4	Chelseas move won backing from drug-testing expert Michelle Verroken.
4	Verroken, a former director of drug-free sport for UK Sport, insists the Blues were right to sack Mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so.
4	Chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate.
4	It was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make.
4	It is a very clear stance by Chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club. It emerged that Mutu had failed a drugs test on October 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine.
4	The Romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance.
4	The Football Association has yet to act on Mutus failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.
4	Ferguson urges Henry punishment Sir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenals Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.
4	Ferguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during Uniteds controversial win.
4	The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooys foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban.
4	We shall present it to the FA and see what they do.
4	The tackle on Heinze was terrible, he said.
4	Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game.
4	The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline.
4	Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinzes head.
4	The striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental.
4	Ferguson was also upset by Arsenals overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own sides behaviour.
4	Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker, he said.
4	There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked.
4	Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge.
4	I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure.
4	We have always been good at being gracious in defeat.
4	What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, dont they? Wenger offers Mutu hope Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger would consider signing Adrian Mutu once the striker has served his drugs ban.
4	Mutu was sacked by Chelsea on Friday after testing positive for cocaine - a move Wenger has backed.
4	But he said: I dont even wonder if that could happen because I think he will be suspended for a long period.
4	But once he has served his suspension, he has the right again to start from zero.
4	I would then meet the player and see what he tells me. Mutu faces a ban of between six months and two years when the Football Association decides on his punishment.
4	Chelsea decided to act before his case was heard and sacked the striker on grounds of gross misconduct after it was revealed that he had failed a drug test.
4	But Mutu has hit out at the clubs decision, saying: Chelsea have destroyed me. He told the Sunday Mirror: I dont know what Im going to do.
4	I am shocked and surprised by their decision.
4	I didnt expect them to pay me while I was suspended but I never thought they would sack me either.
4	Why didnt they wait to do this? Now my career is in ruins.
4	I might as well walk away from football.
4	What is there left for me? Chelsea have been criticised for their stance, with the Professional Footballers Association accusing the club of failing in their duty of care to the player.
4	And Mutu agreed, adding: It is unfair.
4	If they were going to sack me they should have done it afterwards.
4	Why did they go public? To make an example of me? It makes it very difficult for me now. Santini resigns as Spurs manager Tottenham manager Jacques Santini has resigned for personal reasons.
4	The former France manager moved to White Hart Lane this summer but now wants to return to France.
4	Santini said: My time at Tottenham has been memorable and it is with deep regret that I take my leave.
4	I wish the club and the supporters all the best.
4	Private issues in my personal life have arisen which caused my decision.
4	I very much hope that the wonderful fans will respect my decision. He added: I should like to thank (sporting director) Frank Arnesen and (chairman) Daniel Levy for their understanding. Assistant coach Martin Jol has been put in temporary charge and will take care of team affairs for Saturdays Premiership match against Charlton.
4	Arnesen said the club were sad to see Santini go: We are obviously disappointed that Jacques is leaving us.
4	We fully respect his decision.
4	I can assure you that the club will act swiftly to minimise the impact of Jacques departure.
4	Our priority is to ensure that this seasons performance remains unaffected by this move.
4	I shall make a further statement on Monday, clarifying our position.
4	We wish Jacques well. Mutu to hold talks with Juventus Disgraced former Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu is to begin talks with Juventus as he looks for a new club.
4	Mutu will be in our clubs main stand to watch the match between Juventus and Fiorentina, said a Juventus official, who declined to be named.
4	Then he will meet some important people of the club, he added.
4	Mutu, 25, sacked by Chelsea and banned for seven months for taking cocaine, is now represented by Alessandro Moggi, son of Juve manager Luciano Moggi.
4	Mutu, banned by the English FA, can resume playing next May.
4	He is to undergo a drug education and rehabilitation programme.
4	Mutu wants to train with Romanian side Dinamo Bucharest whilst serving his ban, say the Bucharest side.
4	Uefa approves fake grass Uefa says it will allow European matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season.
4	European footballs governing body made the decision at a meeting of its Executive Committee on Wednesday.
4	Uefa explained that the move follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces. They can be used subject to complying with Uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory.
4	Luton, Preston, Queens Park Rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the 1980s but, after a two-year study, Uefa insists the surfaces have moved on.
4	International matches can also be played on such pitches, although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass.
4	Uefa spokesman Rob Faulkner said: People in England have bad memories of the artificial pitches of Luton and QPR in the 1980s, but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass.
4	We have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards. Several leading clubs from Scandinavia, Russia and eastern Europe - especially those who only play Champions League or Uefa Cup matches in winter - are now expected to instal artificial pitches.
4	Yeading face Newcastle in FA Cup Premiership side Newcastle United face a trip to Ryman Premier League leaders Yeading in the FA Cup third round.
4	The game - arguably the highlight of the draw - is a potential money-spinner for non-League Yeading, who beat Slough in the second round.
4	Conference side Exeter City, who knocked out Doncaster on Saturday, will travel to Old Trafford to meet holders Manchester United in January.
4	Arsenal were drawn at home to Stoke and Chelsea will play host to Scunthorpe.
4	The only other non-League side in the draw are Hinckley United, who held Brentford to a goalless draw on Sunday.
4	They will meet League One leaders Luton if they win their replay against Martin Allens team at Griffin Park.
4	A number of Premiership teams face difficult away games against Championship sides on the weekend of 8/9 January.

4	Anelka eyes Man City departure Striker Nicolas Anelka reportedly wants to leave Manchester City in search of Champions League football.
4	Anelka, 25, is in talks over a contract extension beyond 2007 with City but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club.
4	The News of the World reports that Anelka told a French magazine: I either decide to win titles or to have an easy life.
4	I think I will always choose football, if a great club makes me an offer. He added: To win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so.
4	If we stagnate between eighth and 15th place its impossible to progress.
4	If I am going to score goals and not win, there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up. Anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris St Germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him.
4	I am in talks to sign an extension to my contract, he said.
4	I am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account.
4	Playing for eighth place is good but I miss the Champions League.
4	I won it with Real Madrid in 2000 and I need to be playing in it - and I should be playing in it.
4	Im not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football.
4	But I dont blame anyone.
4	Its a bit my fault. Arnesen denies rift with Santini Tottenham sporting director Frank Arnesen has denied that coach Jacques Santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at White Hart Lane.
4	There had been newspaper speculation that Santini had felt undermined by Arnesens role at the club.
4	It is absolutely not true, Arnesen told BBC Radio Five Live.
4	There is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems.
4	He has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself. Arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused Santini to quit after just 13 games in charge.
4	He added: Jacques has never gone into exactly what it was.
4	But I trust him in that; you have to accept it.
4	I think we should respect it.
4	The plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on Monday we will clarify the situation. Arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement, coming less than 24 hours before Tottenhams Premiership fixture with Charlton.
4	When it comes down to personal problems, I dont think we should talk about timing, he said.
4	And he also denied reports that Santini had been given a £3m pay-off.
4	That is absolute nonsense.
4	He is the one who said I will go and so he went, said the Spurs sporting director.
4	Tottenhams structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and Arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.
4	I have confidence in this structure.
4	I am confident that we have started something here in July and I still have a lot of confidence in Tottenham and what we are doing, he said.
4	However, former Spurs and England defender Gary Stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift.
4	I think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at White Hart Lane and Santini, Stevens told Five Live.
4	On paper they could have worked together.
4	But Frank Arnesen was a very creative, forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas I think Santini was very much the opposite, more a case of being organised, disciplined and happy not conceding goals.
4	That sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely.
4	But it seems that has not happened. Souness backs Smith for Scotland Graeme Souness believes Walter Smith would be the perfect choice to succeed Berti Vogts as Scotland manager.
4	Sounesss former assistant at Rangers is hot favourite to take over from Vogts, who resigned on Monday.
4	Walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job.
4	Hed be perfect for it, Souness told BBC Sport.
4	The Scottish Football Association has appointed Tommy Burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against Sweden on 17 November.
4	He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the Scotland team and football.
4	He is experienced and has been successful. Souness added: Walter is a real football person, as I know from working with him at Ibrox.
4	On top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in Scottish football. Souness joined Sir Alex Ferguson in backing Smiths claims.
4	The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing Tommy Burns in a caretaker capacity.
4	Ferguson said: He (Smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as Im concerned.
4	You need somebody who knows what theyre doing and Walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job. The Man Utd boss continued: I dont know what credentials are needed to do the job but its a job that needs a lot of experience.
4	He was my assistant with Scotland and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers.
4	He would need to change the whole shape of Scottish football and radical changes are needed. Smith was assistant to Ferguson at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986.
4	The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term.
4	BBC Sport understands that Smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the Scottish FA.
4	If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain Smiths long-time right-hand man Archie Knox would also play a part in the national team set-up.
4	Smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former Scotland manager Craig Brown.
4	Brown said: Walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt.
4	He would be admirable choice.
4	I spoke to him on Sunday and I got the impression he would take it.
4	He was asking me about it and I was positive. Other candidates for the job include former Scotland midfielders Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister and Vogts assistant Tommy Burns.
4	Gallas sees two-horse race Chelseas William Gallas believes they will battle it out with Arsenal for the Premiership in the coming months.
4	Itll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything, he told BBC Sport.
4	You need to be good and you need a lot of luck.
4	You need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the Arsenal players as it is for the Chelsea boys. We know that we have got the power in our hands just now, added Gallas.
4	But you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago Manchester United picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title.
4	Obviously, nobody at Chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football.
4	We will be challenging to come first as much as every Arsenal player will be challenging to come first. Gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager Jose Mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer.
4	And the French international defender believes Mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of Chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt.
4	Its only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at Chelsea is a fantastic manager like Mourinho, he said.
4	He is the icing on the cake at the club.
4	He has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything.
4	Another incredible quality that Mourinho has is that every player, even though the fans may consider them to be a stars, within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal.
4	Mourinho reminds everyone but he doesnt have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day.
4	It is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year. Tevez - an Argentine in Brazil Some 65 years ago Bernardo Gandulla left Boca Juniors in his native Argentina and headed for Brazil.
4	He arrived at the Vasco da Gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to.
4	He left an impression, but not for reasons he would have wanted.
4	The only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play.
4	Even today, gandula is the term used in Brazil for ballboy.
4	Brazilians delighted in the failure of Gandulla then, and many will delight now if history is repeated.
4	Another Boca Juniors player is coming to Brazil.
4	The new Maradona - Carlos Tevez - is joining Corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year.
4	Corinthians - or the London-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for Tevez.
4	It is particularly strange as - until last week - Tevez was not even an especially big name in Brazil, where the Argentine Championship is not shown.
4	Presumably there is some financial logic behind the move.
4	What is harder to work out is why Tevez should be interested in heading north, rather than across the Atlantic.
4	Argentinas brightest new star hit top form in August as he spearheaded the charge towards the Olympic gold medal.
4	But the subsequent months have not been easy for Tevez.
4	Boca re-signed Martin Palermo, forcing Tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role.
4	And off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - Atletico Madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized.
4	 Hounded by the press, Tevez grew tired of his life in Buenos Aires.
4	So now he says that he is heading for Corinthians in search of tranquillity.
4	 Anyone acquainted with the city of S&#227;o Paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration.
4	Brazils biggest city is a sprawling, ugly, restless metropolis.
4	Once it shared with Buenos Aires the same melancholy air of a city of Italian immigrants.
4	But that world now lies buried under skyscrapers.
4	The most turbulent place in this frenetic city is Sport Club Corinthians.
4	It is the most passionately supported club in Brazil.
4	Pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them, reasoning that unless he did something special the Corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own.
4	That passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays, when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in Brazils big cities.
4	Corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players.
4	Tevez, then, can kiss tranquillity goodbye.
4	He can also say farewell to the Copa Libertadores, South Americas Champions League.
4	Corinthians have not qualified.
4	Indeed, he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match.
4	Next years Brazilian Championship only gets underway at the end of April.
4	Until then he will have to make do with the foolish S&#227;o Paulo State Championship, an appalling waste of his talent.
4	There will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to Argentina.
4	Like so many of the top South American players, Tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left, to pass when he was expected to dribble, to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares.
4	But his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.
4	Edu blasts Arsenal Arsenals Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract.
4	Edus deal expires next summer and he has been linked with Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia.
4	He told BBC Sport: Im not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far.
4	If they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and thats made me think. Edus brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenals current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking.
4	And Edu, 26, added: My brother is due to come to London on Thursday.
4	There is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal.
4	Now I have a choice to stay or go.
4	I want to sort it out as soon as possible, thats in the best interests of both the club and myself.
4	Im going to make my decision after the meeting later this week. Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire.
4	The midfielder, who broke in to the Brazilian national side in 2004, admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three Spanish giants.
4	Edu said: Ive just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested.
4	Thats nice, but Ive never talked to them, so I cant say they want me sign 100%. Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu.
4	Edu added that he had been encouraged by Wengers support for him.
4	I still have a good relationship with Arsene Wenger - hes always said he wants me to sign. Can Smith work Scottish wonders? The worst kept secret in Scottish football was revealed on Thursday when Walter Smith was named as the new national manager.
4	From the moment Berti Vogts miserable tenure in charge of Scotland ended, the former Rangers and Everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post.
4	But is Smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football? The 56-year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums.
4	Scotland have not reached a major finals since the World Cup in 1998 and reaching Germany 2006 looks near impossible, having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race.
4	And the Fifa rankings see Scotland listed at an all time low of 77th, below the likes of Estonia, Ghana, Angola and Thailand.
4	Scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level, so Smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources.
4	Smiths track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game.
4	The man who was Alex Fergusons assistant when Scotland played at the 1986 World Cup won seven league titles with Rangers.
4	And his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games top names, including Ferguson and Graeme Souness, who took him to Ibrox as his assistant in 1986.
4	Characters like Souness, Ferguson and current Ibrox manager Alex McLeish all cite Smiths experience and his expansive knowledge of the Scottish game.
4	Much was made of Vogts inability to express himself to the players and media.
4	That will certainly not be the case with Smith.
4	The former Dundee United and Dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective).
4	But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager.
4	Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents.
4	And it remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts preparation work.
4	A fresh start for the Scottish national team was imperative and Smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands.
4	But will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required... Jansen suffers a further setback Blackburn striker Matt Jansen faces three weeks out after surgery to treat a cartilage problem.
4	But central defender Lorenzo Amoruso is moving closer to fitness following a knee operation.
4	Rovers assistant manager Mark Bowen said: Matt had a small operation to trim knee cartilage.
4	Its a tiny piece of work, which should be a fairly quick recovery.
4	Lorenzo is also jogging for the first time, along with kicking a ball. Jansens career has been dogged by injury since a freak scooter accident two years ago.
4	He returned to first-team action soon after Mark Hughes appointment as Blackburn boss and marked it with a goal against Portsmouth in his first appearance of the season.
4	Bowen added: Im guessing, but I reckon maybe two to three weeks before he is back in action completely. The Rovers assistant boss forecast a longer time spell for Amorusos availability for first-team duties.
4	Bowen said: Theres still some scar tissue present so it will be some weeks.
4	Its a case of see how he goes.
4	You cant put a real time on a comeback, well see how he progresses. Mansfield 0-1 Leyton Orient An second-half goal from Andy Scott condemned Mansfield to a ninth successive game without a win.
4	Early in the second half Wayne Carlisles cross was met by Scott and he blasted the ball home from just outside the penalty area.
4	As Orient chased a second, Mansfield had to clear Alan Whites header off the line and Kevin Pilkington saved well from Michael Simpson.
4	By the end Mansfield fans were chanting for the head of chairman Keith Haslam.

4	Zambia confident and cautious Zambias technical director, Kalusha Bwalya is confident and cautious ahead of the Cosafa Cup final against Angola on Saturday in Lusaka.
4	Bwalya said: Nothing short of victory will do. However Bwalya warned his side not to be too complacent.
4	I dont want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be a difficult game.
4	For me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win. Zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreign-based players.
4	However the 41 year-old Bwalya, who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against Mauritius, is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not.
4	The Chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with a victory concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the countrys top musicians.
4	Both sides are hoping to win the competition for a record third time, and so keep the trophy for good.
4	The Chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for Southern African nations in 1997 and 1998.
4	They were prevented from a third straight win by Angola who knocked out the Zambians at the semi-final stage in 1999.
4	That victory for Angola also marked a first defeat in 14 years for Zambia at Lusakas Independence stadium, where Saturdays game is being played.
4	Angola named just four overseas-based players in their preliminary squad.
4	The Palancas Negras have been unable to secure the release of many of their Portugal-based players.
4	Reaction from Spanish press Englands 1-0 defeat to Spain on Wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the countrys press on Thursday.
4	Controversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of Englands black players, Wayne Rooneys petulance and Englands inept performance.
4	But what did the Spanish press make of the affair? BBC Sport looks at the reaction.
4	There is little coverage of the racist chanting on Wednesday nights game.
4	But AS does cover the English reaction to the pre-match comments from Spain coach Luis Aragones, who highlighted Britains colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding Thierry Henry in October.
4	Journalist Guillem Balague writes: In our country, where multi-culturalism is a new thing, we are in nappies dealing with these things, and have a naivety which makes the English nervous. Marca refers in passing to the booing of Englands black players - but only after referring to the cheers of ole which greeted the long periods of Spanish possession.
4	Aragones no comment to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as Marca focuses on the Spanish coachs praise for his players.
4	Serbia & Montenegros 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Belgium - which could make qualification tougher for Spain - seems to be of greater importance.
4	Elsewhere, the Spanish media criticises its English counterparts for stoking up the racism issue.
4	Were there racist chants against some players? This hasnt happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years, said Spanish Federation press officer Fernando Garrido.
4	So you (English reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this. And Spanish daily ABC accuses English reporters of launching a witch-hunt against Aragones.
4	Perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue, the paper says.
4	What the boy in the Bernabeu did was odd... Rooney seemed intent to kick any Spanish player who approached him. Yet Rooney is seen only as the worst example of many England miscreants, with Gary Neville criticised for continuing the feud between Manchester United and Arsenal for his tackles on Jose Reyes.
4	Ashley Coles treatment of Joaquin, and a Frank Lampard foul on Reyes are also lambasted for their ugliness.
4	Marcas headline says it all: Wayne Rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el Bernab&#233;u (Wayne Rooney became crazy in the Bernabeu) Rooneys display alarms the writer, in particular three chilling fouls on Joaquin, Casillas and Marchena, which could well have left them in the infirmary. And like AS, Marca criticises Gary Neville for leaving a message on Reyes ankle to remind him of the Manchester United-Arsenal clash this month.
4	Spains first-half performance is showered with praise, with Xavi singled out as the biggest star.
4	Xavi did things on Wednesday which were worthy of Maradona, the paper beams, adding, What a work-rate, what dynamism, what vision, what leadership, what a midfield player! On a controversial evening, AS offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: Spanish football players played better football than the English. More plaudits are given to the home team, with Jaime Vargas lauding the manner in which Spain dominated England with order and quality.
4	The paper adds: The bad thing about Spain v England was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition. Vargas does not mention Englands two Galacticos, simply adding in a PS: I have not forgotten to speak of Beckham and Owen.
4	They forgot to play. Kerr frustrated at victory margin Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia.
4	Robbie Keane took his Republic record to 24 with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory.
4	We had more good chances.
4	It is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team, said Kerr.
4	But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win. The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy.
4	Kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory.
4	It was a brilliant goal, fantastic skill by Damien Duff.
4	Robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal. Matchwinner Keane was another full of praise for Duffs role in the goal.
4	It was great play from Damien, said the Tottenham striker.
4	I always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of 10 Duffer is going to get it in the box.
4	Playing three up was something different.
4	Brian Kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young Stephen Elliott getting a run-out.
4	The conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future.
4	It is nice to see young players coming through. Man-of-the-match Duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half.
4	He opted to bring Steve Finnans cross down and shoot against the bar when a close-range header looked the best option.
4	I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights, said the Chelsea star.
4	I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing.
4	We have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers.
4	Hopefully that can continue in 2005. Mourinho plots impressive course Chelseas win at Fulham - confirming their position at the Premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.
4	They have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match.
4	All they need to add now is the big prizes which, as we all know, is the most difficult part of all.
4	One thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed.
4	They beat a very tough Everton at Stamford Bridge, won at Newcastle in the Carling Cup, and then won 4-1 at Fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form.
4	As I said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in Mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now.
4	Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players.
4	It is a priceless commodity.
4	No-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by Mourinho.
4	He is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that way, but he has the silverware to back up the talk.
4	Mourinho doesnt simply talk a good game - hes won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto.
4	Some may criticise his talk, but the words are backed up with actions.
4	Ive also found him to be very realistic whenever Ive heard him.
4	Hes spent a lot of money and it seems to be working, and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked.
4	The buys are now integrating, and in Arjen Robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension.
4	In the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics, and yet he was winning games.
4	You cannot win titles early on in the season, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital.
4	I also thought the criticism was very harsh, because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful.
4	Now they are taking those chances, have the double threat of Robben and Damien Duff, and things are looking good.
4	I just wonder if they lack a predator, particularly with Didier Drogba injured.
4	He was starting to look the part before he was sidelined, but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title.
4	Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League.
4	I felt they would never have a better chance than last season, but they have swept all before them in Europe so far this season.
4	It will now be very interesting to see how Mourinho prioritises things, but his life will be made easier by the size of Chelseas squad.
4	I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season, even when Arsenal were flying at the start, and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind.
4	If anything, what I have seen has confirmed my early impressions.
4	And Chelsea would have taken encouragement from Arsenals rocky defensive display at Spurs, even though they ran out 5-4 winners.
4	Mourinho had his say on that game, complaining: Five-four is a hockey score, not a football score.
4	In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4 I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly.
4	So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful. On a more serious note, it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of Sol Campbell to Arsenal.
4	Much criticism has been aimed at Pascal Cygan, but I believe the problem lies with the absence of Campbell and its overall effect on Arsenals defence.
4	Confidence is a crucial factor in defending.
4	When you start conceding goals, you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area.
4	You think oh no - then find your worst fears confirmed.
4	Arsenal need to reverse the process, with or without Campbell, and get some clean sheets on the board.
4	But the return of Campbell is key.
4	He solidifies the unit, has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck.
4	He is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him.
4	Campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit.
4	Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season.
4	Hearts of Oak 3-2 Cotonsport Hearts of Oak set up an all Ghanaian Confederation Cup final with a 3-2 win over Cameroons Cotonsport Garoua in Accra on Sunday.
4	The win for Hearts means they will play Asante Kotoko in the two-leg final, after the Kumasi team qualified from Group A on Saturday.
4	In the other Group B game Cameroons beat of South Africa 3-2 in Douala, neither side could have qualified for the final.
4	Hearts of Oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while Cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through.
4	Louis Agyemang scored the first two goals for Hearts either side of half time before Ben Don Bortey scored the third.
4	Hearts looked set for a comfortable win but Cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on.
4	First of all Boukar Makaji scored in the 89th minute and then 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the game Andre Nzame III was on target.
4	But it was too little too late for the Cameroonians and Hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final.
4	The first leg of the final will be played in Accra on the weekend of 27-28 November and the second leg two weeks later on the 11 December in Kumasi.
4	In the other Group B game Cameroons Sable Batie took the lead in the 35th minute through Kemadjou before Santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to Thokozani Xaba .
4	Bernard Ngom put Sable ahead just five minutes later and then Ernest Nfor settled the game on 68 minutes.
4	Ruben Cloete scored the South African sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock.
4	Curbishley delight for Johansson Charlton manager Alan Curbishley paid tribute to two-goal striker Jonatan Johansson after beating Norwich.
4	Curbishley said after the 4-0 win: There was talk about Norwich being interested in the summer but I have a lot of faith in Jonatan.
4	When there was talk of other clubs I just told him he was going nowhere.
4	Hes part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on.
4	Im sure hes happy here, but I was delighted with all the players. Curbishley was subjected to criticism from Charlton fans recently, and he said: The thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction.
4	Thats happened for however long Ive been here and we dont want people taking sides. Lennon brands Rangers favourites Celtics Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered slight favourites for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win.
4	Lennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings.
4	Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks, he said.
4	But its a game we believe were capable of winning if we play our best, he told the Evening Times.
4	All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in.
4	Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches.
4	At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I dont think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out.
4	Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run.
4	Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing. McClaren hails Boros Uefa spirit Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with European football after the 2-0 Uefa Cup win against Lazio.
4	Boro, who are playing in Europe for the first time in their 128-year history, are top of Group E with maximum points.
4	I think we have taken to Europe really well, said McClaren.
4	We got about Lazio, didnt let them settle or play.
4	And in possession, we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward. Before the match, McClaren had said that a win over the Italian giants would put Boro firmly on the European footballing map.
4	And after they did just that he said: It was a perfect European night.
4	For the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake.
4	There have been many good performances but this was something special.
4	You can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing.
4	To win in Europe you need to defend well, and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games.
4	We can also score goals, and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had, so we have good balance.
4	McClarens only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals.
4	It should have been more convincing, said McClaren.
4	But I had watched Lazio in recent weeks and I saw them score a late equaliser against Inter Milan on Saturday so I knew we needed a second goal.
4	No matter what anybody says, Lazio are favourites to win this competition. Middlesbrough forward Boudewijn Zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals.
4	We didnt expect it to be that one-sided, said Zenden.
4	We did quite well in the first half, we pressured them and they didnt cope with that.
4	I think we played quite well and it was a very good game, especially in the first half. The Holland international said Boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games.
4	Weve got a very good feeling, there is a good spirit, all the lads work hard for each other and its a squad of friendly players, which I think you can see on the pitch, he added.
4	Benitez delight after crucial win Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez admitted victory against Deportivo La Coruna was vital in their tight Champions League group.
4	Jorge Andrades early own goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win.
4	And Benitez said: We started at a very high tempo and had many chances.
4	It is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals.
4	We were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack.
